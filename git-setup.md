# Configuring git

## Create an account on GitHub

Create a free individual account by following the instructions at <https://github.com/pricing>.

## Install command-line git tools

Follow the instructions at <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git> (first options for each operating system)

## Initialize your local git settings

Open a terminal and enter the following commands, replacing John Doeâ€™s information with the name and email address that you used when you configured your account on GitHub. You only have to do this once (on each computer that you use). 

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```
