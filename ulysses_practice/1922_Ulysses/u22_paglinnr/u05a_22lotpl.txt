68.01  <p>By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
68.02  Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher's, the postal telegraph office. Could
68.03  have given that address too. And past the sailors' home. He turned from the
68.04  morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. By Brady's
68.05  cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed
68.06  fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly
68.07  holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won't grow. O let
68.08  him! His life isn't such a bed of roses! Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.
68.09  Come home to ma, da. Slack hour: won't be many there. He crossed
68.10  Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph,
68.11  Beth. And past Nichols' the undertaker's. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay
68.12  Corny Kelleher bagged that job for O'Neill's. Singing with his eyes shut.
68.13  Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout. Her
68.14  name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. O, surely
68.15  he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumay call. With my tooraloom,
68.16  tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.</p>
68.17  <p>In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
68.18  Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
68.19  finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom
68.20  Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read
68.21  blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand
68.22  with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under their
68.23  dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his
68.24  high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his
68.25  hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to
68.26  his waistcoat pocket.</p>
68.27  <p>So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over  again: choice
69.01  blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it must
69.02  be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery
69.03  meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like that. Those Cinghalese
69.04  lobbing around in the sun, in <i>dolce far niente</i>. Not doing a hand's turn all day.
69.05  Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to quarrel. Influence of the climate.
69.06  Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic
69.07  gardens. Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in
69.08  the air. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where
69.09  was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah,  in the dead sea, floating on
69.10  his back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so
69.11  thick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in
69.12  the water is equal to the weight of the.  Or is it the volume is equal to the
69.13  weight? It's a law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his
69.14  fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What is
69.15  weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second, per second.
69.16  Law of falling bodies: per second, per second. They all fall to the ground.
69.17  The earth. It's the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.</p>
69.18  <p>He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with
69.19  her sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <i>Freeman</i>
69.20  from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at
69.21  each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in to see.
69.22  Per second, per second. Per second for every second it means. From the
69.23  curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice. Too late
69.24  box. Post here. No-one. In.</p>
69.25  <p>He handed the card through the brass grill.</p>
69.26  <p>--Are there any letters for me? he asked.</p>
69.27  <p>While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
69.28  poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against
69.29  his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too
69.30  far last time.</p>
69.31  <p>The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.
69.32  He thanked  and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.</p>
69.33  <p>Henry Flower, Esq,</p>
69.34  <p>c/o P.O. Westland Row,</p>
69.35  <p>City.</p>
70.01  <p>Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, revie-//wing
70.02  again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment? Castoff
70.03  soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a grenadier. Pointed
70.04  cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That
70.05  must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and
70.06  drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell street at
70.07  night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on the same tack
70.08  now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover
70.09  empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front. Mark time. Table:
70.10  able. Bed: ed. The King's own. Never see him dressed up as a fireman or
70.11  a bobby. A mason, yes.</p>
70.12  <p>He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if that
70.13  would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its
70.14  way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay
70.15  a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the letter and crumpled the
70.16  envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.</p>
70.17  <p>M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company
70.18  when you.</p>
70.19  <p>--Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?</p>
70.20  <p>--Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.</p>
70.21  <p>--How's the body?</p>
70.22  <p>--Fine. How are you?</p>
70.23  <p>--Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.</p>
70.24  <p>His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:</p>
70.25  <p>--Is there any ... no trouble I hope? I see you're ...</p>
70.26  <p>--O no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.</p>
70.27  <p>--To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?</p>
70.28  <p>A photo it isn't. A badge maybe</p>
70.29  <p>--E ... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.</p>
70.30  <p>--I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard
70.31  it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?</p>
70.32  <p>--I know.</p>
70.33  <p>Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
70.34  of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood
70.35  still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets
70.36  for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this,
70.37  looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch
71.01  pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. Women all for caste
71.02  till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to
71.03  yield. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her
71.04  once take the starch out of her.</p>
71.05  <p>--I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what
71.06  do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.</p>
71.07  <p>Doran, Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In
71.08  came Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
71.09  his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided
71.10  drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.
71.11  Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will she get up?</p>
71.12  <p>--And he said: <i>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?</i>
71.13  I said. <i>Poor little Paddy Dignam,</i> he said.</p>
71.14  <p>Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces
71.15  dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he fostering over that change for? Sees
71.16  me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings to
71.17  her bow.</p>
71.18  <p>--<i>Why?</i> I said. <i>What's wrong with him?</i> I said.</p>
71.19  <p>Proud: rich: silk stockings.</p>
71.20  <p>--Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
71.21  <p>He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a
71.22  minute.</p>
71.23  <p>--<i>What's wrong with him,</i> he said. <i>He's dead,</i> he said. And, faith, he
71.24  filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam?</i> I said. I couldn't believe it when I heard it. I
71.25  was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch. <i>Yes,</i>
71.26  he said. <i>He's gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow.</i></p>
71.27  <p>Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!</p>
71.28  <p>A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.</p>
71.29  <p>Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and
71.30  the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace
71.31  street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the
71.32  display of. <i>Esprit de corps.</i> Well, what are you gaping at?</p>
71.33  <p>--Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.</p>
71.34  <p>--One of the best, M'Coy said.</p>
71.35  <p>The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
71.36  gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the
71.37  sun: flicker, flick.</p>
72.01  <p>--Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.</p>
72.02  <p>--O yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.</p>
72.03  <p>He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:</p>
72.04  <p><i>What is home without</i></p>
72.05  <p><i>Plumtree's Potted Meat?</i></p>
72.06  <p><i>Incomplete.</i></p>
72.07  <p><i>With it an abode of bliss.</i></p>
72.08  <p>--My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.</p>
72.09  <p>Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.</p>
72.10  <p>Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness:</p>
72.11  <p>--My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the
72.12  Ulster hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.</p>
72.13  <p>--That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it up?</p>
72.14  <p>Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread
72.15  and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady
72.16  and fair man. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.</p>
72.17  <p><i>Love's</i></p>
72.18  <p><i>Old</i></p>
72.19  <p><i>Sweet</i></p>
72.20  <p><i>Song</i></p>
72.21  <p><i>Comes lo-ve's old</i> ...</p>
72.22  <p>--It's a kind of a tour, don't you see? Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
72.23  <i>Sweeeet song.</i> There's a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.</p>
72.24  <p>M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.</p>
72.25  <p>--O well, he said. That's good news.</p>
72.26  <p>He moved to go.</p>
72.27  <p>--Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.</p>
72.28  <p>--Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
72.29  <p>--Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the
72.30  funeral, will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a
72.31  drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
72.32  would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if
72.33  I'm not there, will you?</p>
73.01  <p>--I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.</p>
73.02  <p>--Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly
73.03  could. Well, tolloll. Just C.P. M'Coy will do.</p>
73.04  <p>--That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.</p>
73.05  <p>Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd like
73.06  my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, rivetted
73.07  edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow
73.08  regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to
73.09  this.</p>
73.10  <p>Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just
73.11  got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way:
73.12  for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you know? In the same
73.13  boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can't he hear the diffe-//rence?
73.14  Think he's that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow.
73.15  Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there doesn't
73.16  get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated again. Your wife
73.17  and my wife.</p>
73.18  <p>Wonder is he pimping after me?</p>
73.19  <p>Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
73.20  hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's summer
73.21  sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. <i>Leah</i> tonight: Mrs Bandman Palmer.
73.22  Like to see her in that again. <i>Hamlet</i> she played last night. Male impersonator.
73.23  Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed suicide? Poor papa! How
73.24  he used to talk about Kate Bateman in that! Outside the Adelphi in London
73.25  waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.
73.26  And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is.
73.27  Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind
73.28  Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.</p>
73.29  <p>--Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left
73.30  his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
73.31  father and left the God of his father.</p>
73.32  <p>Every word is so deep, Leopold.</p>
73.33  <p>Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad. I didn't go into the room to look at his
73.34  face. That day! O dear! O dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was the best for him.</p>
73.35  <p>Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
73.36  hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met that
73.37  M'Coy fellow.</p>
74.01  <p>He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing
74.02  teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten
74.03  reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care
74.04  about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too full for words.
74.05  Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded too: a stump of
74.06  black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches. Might be happy all
74.07  the same that way. Good poor brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very
74.08  irritating.</p>
74.09  <p>He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
74.10  carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.</p>
74.11  <p>He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies,
74.12  all weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. <i>Voglio e non.</i>
74.13  Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying syllables as
74.14  they pass. He hummed:</p>
74.15  <p><i>Là ci darem la mano</i></p>
74.16  <p><i>La la lala la la.</i></p>
74.17  <p>He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the
74.18  lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins and
74.19  tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its for-//gotten
74.20  pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted child at
74.21  marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby, a blinking
74.22  sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb them. Mohammed cut a
74.23  piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it. And once I played marbles
74.24  when I went to that old dame's school. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis's.
74.25  And Mr? He opened the letter within the newspaper.</p>
74.26  <p>A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not annoyed
74.27  then? What does she say?</p>
74.28  <p>Dear Henry,</p>
74.29  <p>I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry
74.30  you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully
74.31  angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty
74.32  boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real
75.01  meaning of that word. Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty
75.02  boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you think
75.03  of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when
75.04  will we meet? I think of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt
75.05  myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me
75.06  a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So
75.07  now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.
75.08  O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my
75.09  patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty
75.10  darling. I have such a bad headache today and write <i>by return</i> to your longing</p>
75.11  <p>M<sc>artha</sc>.</p>
75.12  <p>P.S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to
75.13  know.</p>
75.14  <p>He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and
75.15  placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it because no-one
75.16  can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then, walking slowly
75.17  forward, he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word. Angry
75.18  tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don't please poor
75.19  forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet
75.20  all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume. Having read it all he took it
75.21  from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.</p>
75.22  <p>Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did
75.23  she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,
75.24  respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank you:
75.25  not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners. Bad as
75.26  a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go further next time.
75.27  Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course. Brutal, why not? Try it
75.28  anyhow. A bit at a time.</p>
75.29  <p>Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common
75.30  pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned
75.31  together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without
75.32  thorns.</p>
75.33  <p>Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the
75.34  Coombe, linked together in the rain.</p>
76.01  <p><i>O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.</i></p>
76.02  <p><i>She didn't know what to do</i></p>
76.03  <p><i>To keep it up</i></p>
76.04  <p><i>To keep it up.</i></p>
76.05  <p>It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting
76.06  all day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your
76.07  wife use? Now could you make out a thing like that.</p>
76.08  <p><i>To keep it up.</i></p>
76.09  <p>Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
76.10  faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also the
76.11  two sluts in the Coombe would listen.</p>
76.12  <p><i>To keep it up.</i></p>
76.13  <p>Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:
76.14  quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been, strange
76.15  customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives,
76.16  lovely cool water out of the well stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.
76.17  Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches. She listens
76.18  with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence.
76.19  Long long long rest.</p>
76.20  <p>Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in
76.21  shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away, sank
76.22  in the dank air: a white flutter then all sank.</p>
76.23  <p>Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
76.24  same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque
76.25  for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out of
76.26  porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times
76.27  a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A million pounds, wait a moment.
76.28  Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one
76.29  and fourpence a gallon of porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about.
76.30  Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.</p>
76.31  <p>What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.</p>
76.32  <p>An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
76.33  Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The
76.34  bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,
76.35  winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of
76.36  liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.</p>
77.01  <p>He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch
77.02  he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the
77.03  leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for a pass to
77.04  Mullingar.</p>
77.05  <p>Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee
77.06  S.J. on saint Peter Claver  and the African mission  Save China's millions.
77.07  Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium.
77.08  Celestials. Rank heresy for them. Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone
77.09  they had too when he was almost unconscious. The protestants  the same.
77.10  Convert Dr William. J. Walsh. D.D. to the true religion. Buddha their god
77.11  lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.
77.12  Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Home. Crown of thorns and cross. Clever
77.13  idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham
77.14  knows him: distinguished looking. Sorry I didn't work him about getting
77.15  Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn't.
77.16  They're taught that. He's not going out in bluey specs whit the sweat rolling
77.17  off him to baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.
77.18  Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.
77.19  Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.</p>
77.20  <p>The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps, pushed
77.21  the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.</p>
77.22  <p>Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place
77.23  to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow
77.24  music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the
77.25  benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at
77.26  the altar rails. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his
77.27  hands. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are
77.28  they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank.
77.29  Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into
77.30  her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and
77.31  open your mouth. What? <i>Corpus.</i> Body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin. Stupe-//fies
77.32  them first. Hospice for the dying. They don't seem to chew it: only
77.33  swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse why the cannibals cotton
77.34  to it.</p>
77.35  <p>He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
77.36  one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in its
77.37  corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. We ought
78.01  to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and there,
78.02  with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their
78.03  stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort of bread: unleavened
78.04  shewbread.  Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. Lollipop. It
78.05  does. Yes, bread of angels it's called. There's a big idea behind it, kind of
78.06  kingdom of God is within you feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a
78.07  lump. Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same
78.08  swim. They do. I'm sure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then
78.09  come out a bit spreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it.
78.10  Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.
78.11  Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith.
78.12  Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.</p>
78.13  <p>He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
78.14  instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he
78.15  had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what to do to.
78.16  Bald spot behind. Letters on his back I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me
78.17  one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is. And the
78.18  other one? Iron nails ran in.</p>
78.19  <p>Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up
78.20  with a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here
78.21  with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.
78.22  Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the invincibles
78.23  he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.
78.24  This very church. Peter Carey. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. Denis Carey.
78.25  And just imagine that. Wife and six children at home. And plotting that
78.26  murder all the time. Those crawthumpers, now that's a good name for them,
78.27  there's always something shiftylooking about them. They're not straight men
78.28  of business either. O no she's not here: the flower: no, no. By the way did I
78.29  tear up that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.</p>
78.30  <p>The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
78.31  smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what
78.32  they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley's
78.33  Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale (aromatic). Doesn't
78.34  give them any of it: show wine: only the other. Cold comfort. Pious fraud
78.35  but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old booser worse than another
78.36  coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the whole atmosphere of the.
78.37  Quite right. Perfectly right that is.</p>
79.01  <p>Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.
79.02  Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make
79.03  that instrument talk, the <i>vibrato:</i> fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gar-//diner
79.04  street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the <i>Stabat Mater</i> of Rossini.
79.05  Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ, but don't
79.06  keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped. Could hear a
79.07  pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. I could feel the
79.08  thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:</p>
79.09  <p><i>Quis est homo?</i></p>
79.10  <p>Some of that old sacred music is splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
79.11  Mozart's twelfth mass: the <i>Gloria</i> in that. Those old popes were keen on
79.12  music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example too.
79.13  They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too chanting, regular hours,
79.14  then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in
79.15  their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is it? Must
79.16  be curious to hear after their own strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they
79.17  wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh
79.18  don't they? Gluttons, tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out
79.19  of it.</p>
79.20  <p>He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
79.21  bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced
79.22  about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the
79.23  gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back
79.24  quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing
79.25  out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then
79.26  the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:</p>
79.27  <p>--O God, our refuge and our strength ...</p>
79.28  <p>Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them
79.29  the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Gloria and
79.30  immaculate virgin. Joseph her spouse. Peter and Paul. More interesting if you
79.31  understood what it was all about. Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like
79.32  clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will tell you all. Penance.
79.33  Punish me, please. Great weapon in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor.
79.34  Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha?
79.35  And why did you? Look down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering
79.36  gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke.
79.37  Then out she comes. Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar.
80.01  Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her
80.02  blushes. Salvation army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address
80.03  the meeting. How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in
80.04  Rome: they work the whole show. And don't they rake in the money too?
80.05  Bequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses
80.06  for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. Monasteries and
80.07  convents. The priest in the Fermanagh will case in the witness box. No
80.08  browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything. Liberty and exaltation
80.09  of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the church: they mapped
80.10  out the whole theology of it.</p>
80.11  <p>The priest prayed:</p>
80.12  <p>--Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our
80.13  safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him,
80.14  we humbly pray): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power
80.15  of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits
80.16  who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.</p>
80.17  <p>The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women
80.18  remained behind: thanksgiving.</p>
80.19  <p>Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate
80.20  perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.</p>
80.21  <p>He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all
80.22  the time. Woman enjoy it. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me
80.23  before. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a (whh!) just a (whh!)
80.24  fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. Glimpses of the moon.  Still like
80.25  you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south. He passed, discreetly
80.26  buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into rhe light. He
80.27  stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him
80.28  and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy
80.29  water. Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice
80.30  because I'm in mourning myself. He covered himself. How goes the time?
80.31  Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion made up. Where is
80.32  this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny's in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely move.
80.33  Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long's, founded
80.34  in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.</p>
80.35  <p>He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other
80.36  trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair. O well,
80.37  poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up last? Wait.
81.01  I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must have been or the
81.02  second. O he can look it up in the prescriptions book.</p>
81.03  <p>The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems
81.04  to have, Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone. The
81.05  alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why?
81.06  Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character. Living
81.07  all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his alabaster lilypots.
81.08  Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid. Smell almost cure you like
81.09  the dentist's doorbell. Doctor whack. He ought to physic himself a bit.
81.10  Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself
81.11  had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to be careful. Enough stuff here to
81.12  chloroform you. Test: turns blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of
81.13  laudanum. Sleeping draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for
81.14  cough. Clogs the pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where
81.15  you least expect it. Clever of nature.</p>
81.16  <p>--About a fortnight ago, sir?</p>
81.17  <p>--Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
81.18  <p>He waited by the counter, inhaling  the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry
81.19  smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.</p>
81.20  <p>--Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
81.21  orangeflower water ...</p>
81.22  <p>It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.</p>
81.23  <p>--And white wax also, he said.</p>
81.24  <p>Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her
81.25  eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs. Those
81.26  homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and
81.27  rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood. One of the
81.28  old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin. Leopold, yes.
81.29  Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse. But you want
81.30  a perfume too. What perfume does your? <i>Peau d'Espagne.</i> That orange-//flower.
81.31  Pure curd soap. Water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have.
81.32  Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets
81.33  rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in
81.34  the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure.
81.35  Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all  day. Funeral be rather glum.</p>
81.36  <p>--Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a
81.37  bottle?</p>
82.01  <p>--No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and
82.02  I'll take one of those soaps. How much are they?</p>
82.03  <p>--Fourpence, sir.</p>
82.04  <p>Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p>
82.05  <p>--I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.</p>
82.06  <p>--Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
82.07  come back.</p>
82.08  <p>--Good, Mr Bloom said.</p>
82.09  <p>He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
82.10  coolwrappered soap in his left hand.</p>
82.11  <p>At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:</p>
82.12  <p>--Hello, Bloom, what's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute.</p>
82.13  <p>Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
82.14  younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.</p>
82.15  <p>Bantam Lyons' yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a
82.16  wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears' soap.
82.17  Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.</p>
82.18  <p>--I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam
82.19  Lyons' said. Where the bugger is it?</p>
82.20  <p>He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. Barber's
82.21  itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the paper and get shut of
82.22  him.</p>
82.23  <p>--You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.</p>
82.24  <p>--Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum
82.25  the second.</p>
82.26  <p>--I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.</p>
82.27  <p>Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
82.28  <p>--What's that? his sharp voice said.</p>
82.29  <p>--I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it
82.30  away that moment.</p>
82.31  <p>Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
82.32  sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms.</p>
82.33  <p>--I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</p>
82.34  <p>He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.</p>
82.35  <p>Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
82.36  in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it lately.
82.37  Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large tender turkey.
83.01  Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble
83.02  then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. They never come back.
83.03  Fleshpots of Egypt.</p>
83.04  <p>He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
83.05  mosque redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He eyed the
83.06  horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in
83.07  a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like a wheel. Then the
83.08  spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college. Something to catch
83.09  the eye.</p>
83.10  <p>There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands:
83.11  might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower?
83.12  How do you do, sir?</p>
83.13  <p>Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather. Sit
83.14  around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it here. Duck
83.15  for six wickets. Still Captain Buller broke a window in the Kildare street club
83.16  with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line. And the skulls
83.17  we were acracking when M'Carthy took the floor. Heatwave. Won't last.
83.18  Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer
83.19  than them all.</p>
83.20  <p>Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
83.21  stream. This is my body.</p>
83.22  <p>He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
83.23  warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and
83.24  limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:
83.25  his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating,
83.26  floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid
83.27  floating flower.</p>
