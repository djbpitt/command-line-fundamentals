619.01  <p>What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?</p>
619.02  <p>Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford Place they
619.03  followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy
619.04  square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an
619.05  inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then, at
619.06  reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north,
619.07  as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they
619.08  crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in
619.09  any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.</p>
619.10  
619.11  <p>Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?</p>
619.12  <p>Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution,
619.13  diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth
619.14  of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets,
619.15  the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit
619.16  education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent
619.17  influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.</p>
619.18  
619.19  <p>Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective
619.20  like and unlike reactions to experience?</p>
619.21  <p>Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic
619.22  or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a
619.23  cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic
619.24  training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief
619.25  in many orthodox religions, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both
619.26  admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
619.27  magnetism.</p>
619.28  
620.01  <p>Were their views on some points divergent?</p>
620.02  <p>Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of
620.03  dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views
620.04  on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assently
620.05  covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the
620.06  date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by
620.07  Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope
620.08  Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts
620.09  in the reign of Cormac MacArt († 266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect
620.10  deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which
620.11  Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying
620.12  degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
620.13  the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
620.14  attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two
620.15  different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin), at first no bigger than a
620.16  woman's hand.</p>
620.17  
620.18  <p>Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?</p>
620.19  <p>The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
620.20  paraheliotropic trees.</p>
620.21  
620.22  <p>Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
620.23  the past?</p>
620.24  <p>In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
620.25  thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's
620.26  corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield Avenue. In 1885 with
620.27  Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa
620.28  and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occusionally
620.29  with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front
620.30  parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently
620.31  with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and
620.32  separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in
620.33  1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour
620.34  of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.</p>
620.35  
620.36  <p>What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
620.37  1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their
620.38  destination?</p>
620.39  
621.01  <p>He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
621.02  development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction
621.03  of the converse domain of interindividual relations.</p>
621.04  
621.05  <p>As in what ways?</p>
621.06  <p>From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
621.07  existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to
621.08  nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.</p>
621.09  
621.10  <p>What did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
621.11  <p>At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number
621.12  7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his
621.13  trousers to obtain his latchkey.</p>
621.14  
621.15  <p>Was it there?</p>
621.16  <p>It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn
621.17  on the day but one preceding.</p>
621.18  
621.19  <p>Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
621.20  <p>Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
621.21  himself twice not to forget.</p>
621.22  
621.23  <p>What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively)
621.24  and inadvertently, keyless couple?</p>
621.25  <p>To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
621.26  
621.27  <p>Bloom's decision?</p>
621.28  <p>A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area
621.29  railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union
621.30  of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine
621.31  inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and
621.32  allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings
621.33  and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.</p>
621.34  
621.35  <p>Did he fall?</p>
621.36  <p>By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois
621.37  measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in
621.38  the premises of Francis Frœdman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street,
621.39  north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the
622.01  bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era,
622.02  (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one
622.03  thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar
622.04  cycle 9, dominical letters CB, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, <sc>mxmiv</sc>.</p>
622.05  
622.06  <p>Did he rise uninjured by concussion?</p>
622.07  <p>Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
622.08  the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely
622.09  moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained
622.10  retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer
622.11  match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock,
622.12  lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence
622.13  and lit finally a portable candle.</p>
622.14  
622.15  <p>What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?</p>
622.16  <p>Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
622.17  kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle,
622.18  a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen
622.19  holding a candle of 1 CP.</p>
622.20  
622.21  <p>Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
622.22  <p>After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
622.23  through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The
622.24  halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway
622.25  the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
622.26  
622.27  <p>Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
622.28  <p>Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
622.29  softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past
622.30  a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase
622.31  of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.</p>
622.32  
622.33  <p>What did Bloom do?</p>
622.34  <p>He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame,
622.35  drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its
622.36  back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one
622.37  knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various
622.38  coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone
622.39  shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier
623.01  street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer
623.02  match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing
623.03  its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen
623.04  of the air.</p>
623.05  
623.06  <p>Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p>
623.07  <p>Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
623.08  had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college
623.09  of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare:
623.10  of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in
623.11  Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan
623.12  in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his
623.13  mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve
623.14  North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier
623.15  1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university
623.16  College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's
623.17  house in Cabra.</p>
623.18  
623.19  <p>What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the
623.20  fire towards the opposite wall?</p>
623.21  <p>Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched
623.22  between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from
623.23  which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively
623.24  in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender
623.25  tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two
623.26  at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.</p>
623.27  
623.28  <p>What did Bloom see on the range?</p>
623.29  <p>On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger)
623.30  hob a black iron kettle.</p>
623.31  
623.32  <p>What did Bloom do at the range?</p>
623.33  <p>He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle
623.34  to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.</p>
623.35  
623.36  <p>Did it flow?</p>
623.37  <p>Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity
623.38  of 2.400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filtre
624.01  mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5
624.02  per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and
624.03  Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and
624.04  thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city
624.05  boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged
624.06  summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had
624.07  fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough
624.08  surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the
624.09  instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal
624.10  water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility
624.11  of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as
624.12  in 1893) particulary as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their
624.13  ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had
624.14  been convicted of a wastage of 20.000 gallons per night by a reading of their
624.15  meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice,
624.16  solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public,
624.17  selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.</p>
624.18  
624.19  <p>What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
624.20  returning to the range, admire?</p>
624.21  <p>Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in
624.22  seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its
624.23  umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8.000
624.24  fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all
624.25  points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states
624.26  of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap
624.27  and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
624.28  circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
624.29  significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe:
624.30  its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region
624.31  below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its
624.32  primeval basin: its luteosfulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in
624.33  solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious
624.34  metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories:
624.35  its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability
624.36  in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and
624.37  temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental
625.01  lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries
625.02  and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its
625.03  violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
625.04  freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts,
625.05  whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumter-//restrial
625.06  ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed
625.07  by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in
625.08  the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air; distillation of dew: the simplicity
625.09  of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part
625.10  of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead
625.11  Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams,
625.12  leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire,
625.13  nourishing vegetation: its infaillibility as paradigm and paragon: its
625.14  metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in
625.15  rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights
625.16  and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and
625.17  minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs,
625.18  icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos,
625.19  electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,
625.20  rivers, ifnavigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from
625.21  harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna
625.22  and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants
625.23  of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 | of the human body: the
625.24  noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded
625.25  flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.</p>
625.26  
625.27  <p>Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
625.28  return to the stillflowing tap?</p>
625.29  <p>To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's
625.30  lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours
625.31  previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging
625.32  everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered
625.33  holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.</p>
625.34  
625.35  <p>What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?</p>
625.36  <p>That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
625.37  submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of
626.01  October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and
626.02  crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.</p>
626.03  
626.04  <p>What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
626.05  prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary
626.06  wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the
626.07  face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing,
626.08  the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape,
626.09  stomach and thenar or sole of foot?</p>
626.10  <p>The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.</p>
626.11  
626.12  <p>What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?</p>
626.13  <p>Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy
626.14  in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and
626.15  the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.</p>
626.16  
626.17  <p>Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?</p>
626.18  <p>Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
626.19  recuperation.</p>
626.20  
626.21  <p>What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
626.22  agency of fire?</p>
626.23  <p>The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of
626.24  ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated
626.25  from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous
626.26  coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of
626.27  primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the
626.28  sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent
626.29  luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion
626.30  developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from
626.31  the course of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
626.32  through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected,
626.33  in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the
626.34  water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the
626.35  result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water
626.36  from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.</p>
626.37  
627.01  <p>What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?</p>
627.02  <p>A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
627.03  both sides simultaneously.</p>
627.04  
627.05  <p>For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?</p>
627.06  <p>To shave himself.</p>
627.07  
627.08  <p>What advantages attended shaving by night?</p>
627.09  <p>A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
627.10  shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering
627.11  female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections
627.12  upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher
627.13  sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan,
627.14  a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the
627.15  same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught
627.16  with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision
627.17  plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be
627.18  done.</p>
627.19  
627.20  <p>Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?</p>
627.21  <p>Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
627.22  feminine passive active hand.</p>
627.23  
627.24  <p>What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
627.25  influence?</p>
627.26  <p>The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
627.27  blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order,
627.28  heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.</p>
627.29  
627.30  <p>What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the
627.31  kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?</p>
627.32  <p>On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast
627.33  saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted,
627.34  and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy
627.35  purse dispaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits.
627.36  On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table
627.37  salt, four conglomerated black olivesin oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
628.01  Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing
628.02  one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid
628.03  port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's
628.04  soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a
628.05  crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised
628.06  lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,
628.07  bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model
628.08  Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of
628.09  soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and
628.10  semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's
628.11  and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity
628.12  originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a
628.13  slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various
628.14  sizes and proveniences.</p>
628.15  
628.16  <p>What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?</p>
628.17  <p>Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered
628.18  8 87, 8 86.</p>
628.19  
628.20  <p>What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?</p>
628.21  <p>Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative
628.22  of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of
628.23  which he had read in the <i>Evening Telegraph,</i> late pink edition, in the cabman's
628.24  shelter, at Butt bridge.</p>
628.25  
628.26  <p>Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been
628.27  received by him?</p>
628.28  <p>In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in
628.29  David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower,
628.30  outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway
628.31  (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion:
628.32  in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.W Sweny and Co (Limited),
628.33  dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and
628.34  successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue or
628.35  the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> and <i>National Press</i> which he had been about to throw
628.36  away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental
628.37  edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of
629.01  inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of
629.02  the race, graven in the language of prediction.</p>
629.03  
629.04  <p>What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?</p>
629.05  <p>The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed
629.06  its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge
629.07  and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total
629.08  sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.</p>
629.09  
629.10  <p>His mood?</p>
629.11  <p>He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
629.12  was satisfied.</p>
629.13  
629.14  <p>What satisfied him?</p>
629.15  <p>To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to
629.16  others. Light to the gentiles.</p>
629.17  
629.18  <p>How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?</p>
629.19  <p>He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's
629.20  soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the
629.21  label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients
629.22  for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.</p>
629.23  
629.24  <p>What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
629.25  guest?</p>
629.26  <p>Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
629.27  Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he
629.28  substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily
629.29  to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself, the viscous cream ordinarily
629.30  reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).</p>
629.31  
629.32  <p>Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
629.33  hospitality?</p>
629.34  <p>His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted
629.35  them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the
629.36  creature cocoa.</p>
629.37  
630.01  <p>Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
630.02  reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the
630.03  act begun?</p>
630.04  <p>The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side
630.05  of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs,
630.06  if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.</p>
630.07  
630.08  <p>Who drank more quickly?</p>
630.09  <p>Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,
630.10  from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow
630.11  of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to
630.12  three.</p>
630.13  
630.14  <p>What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?</p>
630.15  <p>Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
630.16  engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
630.17  literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to
630.18  the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult
630.19  problems in imaginary or real life.</p>
630.20  
630.21  <p>Had he found their solution?</p>
630.22  <p>In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided
630.23  by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers
630.24  not bearing in all points.</p>
630.25  
630.26  <p>What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
630.27  potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of
630.28  three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the <i>Shamrock,</i> a weekly
630.29  newspaper?</p>
630.30  <p><i>An ambition to squint</i></p>
630.31  <p><i>At my verses in print</i></p>
630.32  <p><i>Makes me hope that for these you'll find room</i></p>
630.33  <p><i>If you so condescend</i></p>
630.34  <p><i>Then please place at the end</i></p>
630.35  <p><i>The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.</i></p>
630.36  
630.37  <p>Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?</p>
630.38  <p>Name, age, race, creed.</p>
630.39  
631.01  <p>What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?</p>
631.02  <p>Leopold Bloom</p>
631.03  <p>Ellpodbomool</p>
631.04  <p>Molldopeloob</p>
631.05  <p>Bollopedoom</p>
631.06  <p>Old Ollebo, M.P.</p>
631.07  
631.08  <p>What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet)
631.09  sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?</p>
631.10  <p><i><b>P</b>oets oft have sung in rhyme</i></p>
631.11  <p><i><b>O</b>f music sweet their praise divine.</i></p>
631.12  <p><i><b>L</b>et them hymn it nine times nine.</i></p>
631.13  <p><i><b>D</b>earer far than song or wine.</i></p>
631.14  <p><i><b>Y</b>ou are mine. The world is mine.</i></p>
631.15  
631.16  <p>What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.G.
631.17  Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled
631.18  <i>If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now,</i> commissioned by
631.19  Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King
631.20  street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of
631.21  the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime
631.22  <i>Sinbad the Sailor</i> (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson
631.23  and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan produced by R. Shelton 26
631.24  December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets
631.25  by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,
631.26  principal girl?</p>
631.27  <p>Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the
631.28  anticipatep diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the
631.29  posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension
631.30  of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their
631.31  Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King
631.32  Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
631.33  professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall
631.34  on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins Street: fourthly, distraction
631.35  resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political,
631.36  non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly
632.01  Bouverist's revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-
632.02  topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly,
632.03  the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions
632.04  from <i>Everybody's Book of Jokes</i> (1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly,
632.05  the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the
632.06  new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new
632.07  sollicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.</p>
632.08  
632.09  <p>What relation existed between their ages?</p>
632.10  <p>16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen
632.11  was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age
632.12  Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their
632.13  ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion
632.14  increasing and the disparity diminishing according arbitrary as future years
632.15  were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable,
632.16  conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom
632.17  would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was,
632.18  Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the
632.19  maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been
632.20  born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum
632.21  antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would
632.22  continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom
632.23  would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged
632.24  to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.</p>
632.25  
632.26  <p>What events might nullify these calculations?</p>
632.27  <p>The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new
632.28  era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of
632.29  the human species, inevitable but impredictable.</p>
632.30  
632.31  <p>How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?</p>
632.32  <p>Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house. Medina
632.33  Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's
632.34  mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in
632.35  salutation. The second in the cofferoom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in
632.36  the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's
632.37  granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.</p>
632.38  
633.01  <p>Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
633.02  afterwards seconded by the father?</p>
633.03  <p>Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
633.04  gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.</p>
633.05  
633.06  <p>Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
633.07  third connecting link between them?</p>
633.08  <p>Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house
633.09  of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had
633.10  also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel
633.11  owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the
633.12  years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided
633.13  also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph
633.14  Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin
633.15  Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
633.16  
633.17  <p>Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
633.18  <p>He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm
633.19  widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with
633.20  slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road
633.21  opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain
633.22  time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable
633.23  citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres,
633.24  hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and
633.25  brakes passing from the city to the Phœnix Park and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
633.26  
633.27  <p>Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
633.28  <p>Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
633.29  bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes
633.30  of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles,
633.31  passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round
633.32  precipitous globe.</p>
633.33  
633.34  <p>What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
633.35  <p>The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious
633.36  wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the
633.37  younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception,
634.01  her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael
634.02  Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>
634.03  
634.04  <p>Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
634.05  which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more
634.06  desirable?</p>
634.07  <p>The indoor exercices, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
634.08  abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's <i>Physical Strength and How To Obtain
634.09  It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary
634.10  occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror
634.11  so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively
634.12  a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.</p>
634.13  
634.14  <p>Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>
634.15  <p>Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle
634.16  gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in
634.17  his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel
634.18  bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.</p>
634.19  
634.20  <p>Did either openly allude to their racial difference?</p>
634.21  <p>Neither.</p>
634.22  
634.23  <p>What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts
634.24  about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom about Stephen's thoughts about
634.25  Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?</p>
634.26  <p>He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
634.27  knew that he knew that he was not.</p>
634.28  
634.29  <p>What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
634.30  parentages?</p>
634.31  <p>Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently
634.32  Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin
634.33  and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and
634.34  Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial
634.35  heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard
634.36  and Christina Goulding (born Grier).</p>
634.37  
635.01  <p>Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
635.02  layman?</p>
635.03  <p>Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.A. alone
635.04  in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe, by James
635.05  O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
635.06  in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.C., in the
635.07  church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend
635.08  Charles Malone, C.C. alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.</p>
635.09  
635.10  <p>Did they find their educational careers similar?</p>
635.11  <p>Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
635.12  through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen
635.13  Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior,
635.14  middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation,
635.15  first arts second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.</p>
635.16  
635.17  <p>Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the
635.18  university of life?</p>
635.19  <p>Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had
635.20  or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</p>
635.21  
635.22  <p>What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
635.23  <p>The scientific. The artistic.</p>
635.24  
635.25  <p>What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
635.26  applied, rather than towards pure, science?</p>
635.27  <p>Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining
635.28  in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation
635.29  of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for
635.30  example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew,
635.31  the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and
635.32  sluice, the suction pump.</p>
635.33  
635.34  <p>Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
635.35  kindergarten?</p>
635.36  <p>Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
635.37  catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve
636.01  constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries,
636.02  arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological
636.03  biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.</p>
636.04  
636.05  <p>What also stimulated him in his cogitations?</p>
636.06  <p>The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,
636.07  the former by his 1 d. bazaar at 42 George's Street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2 d.
636.08  shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhihition at 30 Henry Street,
636.09  admission 2 d., children 1 d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of
636.10  the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols,
636.11  vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility
636.12  (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to
636.13  interest, to convince, to decide.</p>
636.14  
636.15  <p>Such as?</p>

636.35  deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree in a meatpot,

636.37  Plamtroo.</p>
636.38  
637.01  <p>Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
637.02  originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to
637.03  success?</p>
637.04  <p>His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
637.05  by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated
637.06  engaged in writing.</p>
637.07  
637.08  <p>What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?</p>
637.09  <p>Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark
637.10  corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits.
637.11  She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary
637.12  hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs.
637.13  She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper.
637.14  He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary.</p>
637.15  
637.16  <p>What?</p>
637.17  <p>In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel
637.18  Queen's Ho ...</p>
637.19  
637.20  <p>What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?</p>
637.21  <p>The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County Clare where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
637.22  Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in
637.23  consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the
637.24  form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1
637.25  of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of
637.26  27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis)
637.27  after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m.
637.28  on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after
637.29  having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in
637.30  the place aforesaid), the toxin aforesaid, at the general drapery store of James
637.31  Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.</p>
637.32  
637.33  <p>Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
637.34  intuition?</p>
637.35  <p>Coincidence.</p>
637.36  
637.37  <p>Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?</p>
637.38  <p>He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by
637.39  which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.</p>
637.40  
638.01  <p>Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
638.02  him, described by the narrator as <i>A Pisgah Sight of Palestine</i> or <i>The Parable of
638.03  the Plums?</i></p>
638.04  <p>It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
638.05  implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
638.06  (e.g. <i>My Favourite Hero</i> or <i>Procrastination is the Thief of Time</i>) composed during
638.07  schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the
638.08  personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual
638.09  success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogie themes
638.10  (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students
638.11  or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or
638.12  Doctor Dick or Heblon's <i>Studies in Blue</i>, to a publication of certified circulation
638.13  and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic
638.14  auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative
638.15  of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually
638.16  following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet,
638.17  Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise, 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.</p>
638.18  
638.19  <p>Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
638.20  frequently engaged his mind?</p>
638.21  <p>What to do with our wives.</p>
638.22  
638.23  <p>What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?</p>
638.24  <p>Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
638.25  nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess
638.26  or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing
638.27  society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and
638.28  piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety
638.29  entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly
638.30  obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the
638.31  clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected
638.32  and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented
638.33  intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from
638.34  female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of
638.35  evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.</p>
638.36  
638.37  <p>What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
638.38  in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?</p>
639.01  <p>In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
639.02  with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew
639.03  characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct
639.04  method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.
639.05  She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power,
639.06  external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to
639.07  digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned
639.08  the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive
639.09  action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign
639.10  origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both:
639.11  metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), <i>alias</i> (a mendacious person mentioned
639.12  in sacred Scripture).</p>
639.13  
639.14  <p>What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
639.15  such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?</p>
639.16  <p>The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances,
639.17  proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of
639.18  judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.</p>
639.19  
639.20  <p>How had he attemped to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?</p>
639.21  <p>Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
639.22  certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge:
639.23  by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.</p>
639.24  
639.25  <p>With what success had he attempted direct instruction?</p>
639.26  <p>She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest,
639.27  comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
639.28  remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with
639.29  error.</p>
639.30  
639.31  <p>What system had proved more effective?</p>
639.32  <p>Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest.</p>
639.33  
639.34  <p>Example?</p>
639.35  <p>She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
639.36  disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat
639.37  with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.</p>
639.38  
640.01  <p>Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of
640.02  postexilic eminence did he adduce?</p>
640.03  <p>Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author
640.04  of <i>More Nebukim</i> (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such
640.05  eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none
640.06  like Moses (Maimonides).</p>
640.07  
640.08  <p>What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a
640.09  fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission,
640.10  by Stephen?</p>
640.11  <p>That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
640.12  name uncertain.</p>
640.13  
640.14  <p>Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
640.15  selected or rejected race mentioned?</p>
640.16  <p>Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
640.17  Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).</p>
640.18  
640.19  <p>What fragment of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
640.20  languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest
640.21  to host and by host to guest?</p>
640.22  <p>By Stephen: <i>suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin</i> (walk,
640.23  walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).</p>
640.24  <p>By Bloom: <i>Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch</i> (thy temple amid
640.25  thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).</p>
640.26  
640.27  <p>How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
640.28  made in substantiation of the oral comparison?</p>
640.29  <p>On the penultimate blank page of a book entituled of inferior literary
640.30  style, <i>Sweets of Sin</i> (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover
640.31  came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by
640.32  Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and
640.33  modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph,
640.34  daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their
640.35  arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4 and 100.</p>
640.36  
641.01  <p>Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
641.02  extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?</p>
641.03  <p>Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and
641.04  syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.</p>
641.05  
641.06  <p>What points of contact existed between these languages and between
641.07  the peoples who spoke them?</p>
641.08  <p>The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
641.09  servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having taught on the
641.10  plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius
641.11  Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber
641.12  and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical,
641.13  hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious
641.14  literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud
641.15  (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book
641.16  of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution,
641.17  survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites
641.18  in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the
641.19  proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts:
641.20  the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political
641.21  autonomy or devolution.</p>
641.22  
641.23  <p>What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
641.24  ethnically irreducible consummation?</p>
641.25  <p><i>Kolod balejwaw pnimah</i></p>
641.26  <p><i>Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.</i></p>
641.27  
641.28  <p>Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?</p>
641.29  <p>In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.</p>
641.30  
641.31  <p>How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?</p>
641.32  <p>By a periphrastic version of the general text.</p>
641.33  
641.34  <p>In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?</p>
641.35  <p>The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
641.36  hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern
641.37  stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and
641.38  the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).</p>
641.39  
642.01  <p>Did the guest comply with his host's request?</p>
642.02  <p>Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.</p>
642.03  
642.04  <p>What was Stephen's auditive sensation?</p>
642.05  <p>He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
642.06  of the past.</p>
642.07  
642.08  <p>What was Bloom's visual sensation?</p>
642.09  <p>He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
642.10  future.</p>
642.11  
642.12  <p>What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional
642.13  quasisensations of concealed identities?</p>
642.14  <p>Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by
642.15  Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
642.16  leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.</p>
642.17  <p>Auditively, Bloom's: The Traditionnal accent af the ecstasy of catastrophe.</p>
642.18  
642.19  <p>What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
642.20  what exemplars?</p>
642.21  <p>In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
642.22  reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity
642.23  college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars,
642.24  Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or
642.25  Shakespearean: examplars Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle
642.26  († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.</p>
642.27  
642.28  <p>Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange
642.29  legend on an allied theme?</p>
642.30  <p>Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded,
642.31  reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of
642.32  a mechianacal mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been
642.33  consumed.</p>
642.34  
643.01  <p>Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?</p>
643.02  <p><i>Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all</i></p>
643.03  <p><i>Went out for to play ball.</i></p>
643.04  <p><i>And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played</i></p>
643.05  <p><i>He drove it ow'er the je's garden wall.</i></p>
643.06  <p><i>And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played</i></p>
643.07  <p><i>He broke the jew's windows all.</i></p>
643.08  
643.09  <p>  .in</p>
643.10  
643.11  <p>How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?</p>
643.12  <p>With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw
643.13  the unbroken kitchen window.</p>
643.14  
644.01  <p>Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.</p>
644.02  <p><i>Then out came the jew's daughter</i></p>
644.03  <p><i>And she all dressed in green.</i></p>
644.04  <p><i>«Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,</i></p>
644.05  <p><i>And play your ball again.»</i></p>
644.06  
644.07  <p><i>«I can't come back and I won't come back</i></p>
644.08  <p><i>Without my schoolfellows all.</i></p>
644.09  <p><i>For if my master he did hear</i></p>
644.10  <p><i>He'd make it a sorry ball.»</i></p>
644.11  
644.12  <p><i>She took him by the lilywhite hand</i></p>
644.13  <p><i>And led him along the hall</i></p>
644.14  <p><i>Until she led him to a room</i></p>
644.15  <p><i>Where none could hear him call.</i></p>
644.16  
644.17  <p><i>She took a penknife out of her pocket</i></p>
644.18  <p><i>And cut off his little head</i></p>
644.19  <p><i>And now he'll play his ball no more</i></p>
644.20  <p><i>For he lies among the dead.</i></p>
644.21  
644.22  <p>  .in</p>
644.23  
644.24  <p>How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?</p>
644.25  <p>With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's
644.26  daughter, all dressed in green.</p>
644.27  
645.01  <p>Condense Stephen's commentary.</p>
645.02  <p>One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence,
645.03  twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and
645.04  challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him
645.05  unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment,
645.06  and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
645.07  
645.08  <p>Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?</p>
645.09  <p>He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should
645.10  by him not be told.</p>
645.11  
645.12  <p>Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?</p>
645.13  <p>In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.</p>
645.14  
645.15  <p>Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?</p>
645.16  <p>He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
645.17  incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of
645.18  rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence
645.19  of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating
645.20  circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.</p>
645.21  
645.22  <p>From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
645.23  totally immune?</p>
645.24  <p>From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
645.25  sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite
645.26  time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping,
645.27  his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and,
645.28  having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had
645.29  lain, sleeping.</p>
645.30  
645.31  <p>Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
645.32  of his family?</p>
645.33  <p>Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
645.34  (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of
645.35  terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with
645.36  a vacant mute expression.</p>
645.37  
646.01  <p>What other infantile memories had he of her?</p>
646.02  <p>15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
646.03  lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her
646.04  moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll,
646.05  a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry,
646.06  remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate,
646.07  ahallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.</p>
646.08  
646.09  <p>What endemic characteristics were present?</p>
646.10  <p>Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of
646.11  lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its
646.12  most distant intervals.</p>
646.13  
646.14  <p>What memories had he of her adolescence?</p>
646.15  <p>She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn
646.16  entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away
646.17  her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in
646.18  the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she
646.19  went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change
646.20  not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter
646.21  from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student
646.22  (faculty and year not stated).</p>
646.23  
646.24  <p>Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?</p>
646.25  <p>Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.</p>
646.26  
646.27  <p>What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly
646.28  if differently?</p>
646.29  <p>A temporary departure of his cat.</p>
646.30  
646.31  <p>Why similarly, why differently?</p>
646.32  <p>Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
646.33  (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of
646.34  different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.</p>
646.35  
646.36  <p>In other respects were their differences similar?</p>
646.37  <p>In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.</p>
646.38  
647.01  <p>As?</p>
647.02  <p>Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for
647.03  her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's
647.04  green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing
647.05  concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence
647.06  the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in
647.07  order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous
647.08  military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat).
647.09  Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered
647.10  conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which)
647.11  she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have
647.12  accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the
647.13  instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, were differences were similar.</p>
647.14  
647.15  <p>In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock), given as matrimonial
647.16  auguries, to interest and to instruct her?</p>
647.17  <p>As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
647.18  animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the
647.19  secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum,
647.20  exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human
647.21  or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of moveable indicators on an
647.22  unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each
647.23  hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of
647.24  inclination, <i>videlicet</i>, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical
647.25  progression.</p>
647.26  
647.27  <p>In what manners did she reciprocate?</p>
647.28  <p>She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
647.29  him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She
647.30  provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made
647.31  by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating
647.32  his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him
647.33  not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual
647.34  acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth
647.35  part.</p>
647.36  
648.01  <p>What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,
648.02  make to Stephen, noctambulist?</p>
648.03  <p>To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
648.04  Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
648.05  above the kitchen and immediateiy adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his
648.06  host and hostess.</p>
648.07  
648.08  <p>What various advantages would or might have resulted from a
648.09  prolungation of such extemporisation?</p>
648.10  <p>For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host:
648.11  rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration
648.12  of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.</p>
648.13  
648.14  <p>Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and
648.15  a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality
648.16  of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?</p>
648.17  <p>Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through
648.18  daughter.</p>
648.19  
648.20  <p>To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
648.21  return a monosyllabic negative answer?</p>
648.22  <p>If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney
648.23  Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.</p>
648.24  
648.25  <p>What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
648.26  host?</p>
648.27  <p>A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
648.28  of Mrs Mary Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease
648.29  of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).</p>
648.30  
648.31  <p>Was the proposal of asylum accepted?</p>
648.32  <p>Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.</p>
648.33  
648.34  <p>What exchange of money took place between host and guest?</p>
648.35  <p>The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money
648.36  (£ 1-7-0), one pound seven shilling, advanced by the latter to the former.</p>
648.37  
649.01  <p>What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
649.02  declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?</p>
649.03  <p>To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
649.04  residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place
649.05  the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and
649.06  peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both
649.07  speakers were resident in the same place) the <i>Ship</i> hotel and tavern, 6 Lower
649.08  Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland,
649.09  10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a
649.10  public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more
649.11  public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between
649.12  their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).</p>
649.13  
649.14  <p>What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
649.15  selfexcluding propositions?</p>
649.16  <p>The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's
649.17  circus in the Rotunda, Rutland Square, Dublin, anintuitive particoloured clown
649.18  in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium
649.19  where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated
649.20  audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of
649.21  the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin
649.22  (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an
649.23  account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont
649.24  Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
649.25  circuitous or direct, return.</p>
649.26  
649.27  <p>Was the clown Bloom's son?</p>
649.28  <p>No.</p>
649.29  
649.30  <p>Had Bloom's coin returned?</p>
649.31  <p>Never.</p>
649.32  
649.33  <p>Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?</p>
649.34  <p>Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
649.35  amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
649.36  international animosity.</p>
649.37  
650.01  <p>He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating
650.02  these conditions?</p>
650.03  <p>There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
650.04  from human law, as integral parts of the human whole; the necessity of
650.05  destruction to procure alimentary sustenance; the painful character of the
650.06  ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the
650.07  monotonous menstruation, of simian and (particularly) human females extending
650.08  from the age of puberty to the menopause; inevitable accidents at sea, in mines
650.09  and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations,
650.10  innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic
650.11  cataclyms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals
650.12  the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of
650.13  vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
650.14  maturity to decay.</p>
650.15  
650.16  <p>Why did he desist from speculation?</p>
650.17  <p>Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
650.18  more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be
650.19  removed.</p>
650.20  
650.21  <p>Did Stephen participate in his dejection?</p>
650.22  <p>He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
650.23  syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent
650.24  between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude
650.25  of the void.</p>
650.26  
650.27  <p>Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?</p>
650.28  <p>Not verbally. Substantially.</p>
650.29  
650.30  <p>What comforted his misapprehension?</p>
650.31  <p>That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
650.32  the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.</p>
650.33  
650.34  <p>In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the
650.35  exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?</p>
650.36  <p>Lighted Candle in Stick borne by</p>
650.37  <p>B<sc>loom</sc></p>
650.38  <p>Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by</p>
650.39  <p>S<sc>tephen</sc>.</p>
650.40  
651.01  <p>With what intonation <i>secreto</i> of what commemorative psalm?</p>
651.02  <p>The 113th, <i>modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra|:el de Egypto: domus Jacob de
651.03  populo barbaro</i>.</p>
651.04  
651.05  <p>What did each so at the door of egress?</p>
651.06  <p>Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.</p>
651.07  
651.08  <p>For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?</p>
651.09  <p>For a cat.</p>
651.10  
651.11  <p>What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
651.12  guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the
651.13  rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?</p>
651.14  <p>The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.</p>
651.15  
651.16  <p>With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
651.17  companion of various constellation?</p>
651.18  <p>Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
651.19  incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating
651.20  uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the
651.21  lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface
651.22  towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears
651.23  (57,000,000,000,000, miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension
651.24  of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with
651.25  belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems
651.26  could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova
651.27  in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the
651.28  parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from
651.29  immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with
651.30  which the years, threscore and ten, of allotted human life formed a
651.31  parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.</p>
651.32  
651.33  <p>Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?</p>
651.34  <p>Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth:
651.35  of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of
651.36  the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs,
651.37  bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of
651.38  imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single
652.01  pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies,
652.02  themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in
652.03  continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again
652.04  divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors
652.05  ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far
652.06  enough, nought nowhere was never reached.</p>
652.07  
652.08  <p>Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?</p>
652.09  <p>Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem
652.10  of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number
652.11  computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so
652.12  many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having
652.13  been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable
652.14  quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to
652.15  contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds,
652.16  thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions,
652.17  hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every
652.18  series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic
652.19  elaboration of any power of any of its powers.</p>
652.20  
652.21  <p>Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their
652.22  satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral
652.23  redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?</p>
652.24  <p>Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,
652.25  normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when
652.26  elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with
652.27  arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation
652.28  between troposphere and statosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage,
652.29  impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution,
652.30  he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved
652.31  impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of
652.32  beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian,
652.33  Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though
652.34  an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms wiih finite différences
652.35  resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here
652.36  remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities
652.37  and to all that is vanity.</p>
652.38  
653.01  <p>And the problem of possible redemption?</p>
653.02  <p>The minor was proved by the major.</p>
653.03  
653.04  <p>Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?</p>
653.05  <p>The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
653.06  yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their
653.07  magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's
653.08  star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn:
653.09  the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependant gyrations of
653.10  double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius,
653.11  Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and
653.12  Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
653.13  compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant
653.14  orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones:
653.15  the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger
653.16  satroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the
653.17  feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known
653.18  as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence
653.19  of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of
653.20  exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated
653.21  by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns)
653.22  about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
653.23  neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of
653.24  similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and dissapeared from
653.25  the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth
653.26  of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had
653.27  (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of
653.28  Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from
653.29  the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph
653.30  Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or
653.31  after the birth or death of other persons, the attendant phenomena of eclipses,
653.32  solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of
653.33  shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular
653.34  animals, persistance of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of
653.35  human beings.</p>
653.36  
654.01  <p>His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing
654.02  for possible error?</p>
654.03  <p>That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a
654.04  heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the
654.05  known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositious
654.06  probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of
654.07  different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,
654.08  remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present
654.09  before its spectators had entered actual present existence.</p>
654.10  
654.11  <p>Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?</p>
654.12  <p>Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
654.13  delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking
654.14  ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.</p>
654.15  
654.16  <p>Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
654.17  influences upon sublunary disasters?</p>
654.18  <p>It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature
654.19  employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as
654.20  to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews,
654.21  the ocean of fecundity.</p>
654.22  
654.23  <p>What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
654.24  woman?</p>
654.25  <p>Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations:
654.26  her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection:
654.27  her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times,
654.28  waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate
654.29  response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent
654.30  waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render
654.31  insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her
654.32  visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent
654.33  propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her
654.34  motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her
654.35  silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.</p>
654.36  
655.01  <p>What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's
655.02  gaze?</p>
655.03  <p>In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil
655.04  lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank
655.05  O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16
655.06  Aungier street.</p>
655.07  
655.08  <p>How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion
655.09  (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?</p>
655.10  <p>With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
655.11  affection and admiration: with description; with impediment; with suggestion.</p>
655.12  
655.13  <p>Both then were silent?</p>
655.14  <p>Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
655.15  flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.</p>
655.16  
655.17  <p>Were they indefinitely inactive?</p>
655.18  <p>At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then
655.19  Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition
655.20  reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first
655.21  Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous
655.22  shadow.</p>
655.23  
655.24  <p>Similarly?</p>
655.25  <p>The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were
655.26  dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the
655.27  bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High
655.28  School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against
655.29  the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's
655.30  higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had
655.31  augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vescical pressure.</p>
655.32  
655.33  <p>What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
655.34  invisible audible collateral organ of the other?</p>
655.35  <p>To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,
655.36  dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal
655.37  integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass
656.01  and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether
656.02  the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
656.03  church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the
656.04  fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as
656.05  hair and toenails.</p>
656.06  
656.07  <p>What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?</p>
656.08  <p>A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from
656.09  Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice
656.10  towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.</p>
656.11  
656.12  <p>How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?</p>
656.13  <p>By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable
656.14  female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its
656.15  wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward
656.16  spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free
656.17  egress and free ingress.</p>
656.18  
656.19  <p>How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?</p>
656.20  <p>Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base,
656.21  the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle
656.22  less than the sum of two right angles.</p>
656.23  
656.24  <p>What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of
656.25  their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?</p>
656.26  <p>The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
656.27  in the church of Saint George.</p>
656.28  
656.29  <p>What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?</p>
656.30  <p>By Stephen:</p>
656.31  <p><i>Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.</i></p>
656.32  <p><i>Jubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.</i></p>
656.33  <p>By Bloom:</p>
656.34  <p><i>Heigho, heigho,</i></p>
656.35  <p><i>Heigho, heigho.</i></p>
656.36  
657.01  <p>Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that
657.02  day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to
657.03  Glasnevin in the north?</p>
657.04  <p>Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in
657.05  bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),
657.06  John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in
657.07  bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).</p>
657.08  
657.09  <p>Alone, what did Bloom hear?</p>
657.10  <p>The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
657.11  double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.</p>
657.12  
657.13  <p>Alone, what did Bloom feel?</p>
657.14  <p>The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or
657.15  the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient
657.16  intimations of proximate dawn.</p>
657.17  
657.18  <p>Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
657.19  him?</p>
657.20  <p>Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct:
657.21  Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River) Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis
657.22  Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip
657.23  Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street) Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiæ
657.24  hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).</p>
657.25  
657.26  <p>What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?</p>
657.27  <p>The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition
657.28  of a new solar disk.</p>
657.29  
657.30  <p>Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?</p>
657.31  <p>Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of
657.32  Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the
657.33  diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of
657.34  Mizrach, the east.</p>
657.35  
657.36  <p>He remembered the initial paraphenomena?</p>
657.37  <p>More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various
657.38  points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion
658.01  of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent
658.02  sun perceptible low on the horizon.</p>
658.03  
658.04  <p>Did he remain?</p>
658.05  <p>With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the
658.06  passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle,
658.07  reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and
658.08  reentered.</p>
658.09  
658.10  <p>What suddenly arrested his ingress?</p>
658.11  <p>The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
658.12  contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction
658.13  of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of anetcedent
658.14  sensations transmitted and registered.</p>
658.15  
658.16  <p>Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture?</p>
658.17  <p>A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
658.18  the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration
658.19  which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker
658.20  inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place
658.21  vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of
658.22  which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position
658.23  beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of
658.24  the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to
658.25  the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid
658.26  majolicatopped table.</p>
658.27  
658.28  <p>Describe them.</p>
658.29  <p>One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to
658.30  the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a
658.31  rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised
658.32  diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair
658.33  of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to
658.34  seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright
658.35  circle of white plaited rush.</p>
658.36  
658.37  <p>What significances attached to these two chairs?</p>
658.38  <p>Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial
658.39  evidence, of testimonial supermanence.</p>
658.40  
659.01  <p>What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?</p>
659.02  <p>A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting
659.03  a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four
659.04  consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of
659.05  cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice
659.06  and piano of <i>Love's Old Sweet Song</i> (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed
659.07  by J.L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with
659.08  the final indications <i>ad libitum, forte,</i> pedal, <i>animato,</i> sustained, pedal, <i>ritirando,</i>
659.09  close.</p>
659.10  
659.11  <p>With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?</p>
659.12  <p>With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple
659.13  a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull
659.14  passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning
659.15  the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi
659.16  Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure,
659.17  repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels
659.18  of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion
659.19  of gradual discolouration.</p>
659.20  
659.21  <p>His next proceeding?</p>
659.22  <p>From an open box on tbe majolicatopped table he extracted a black
659.23  diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin
659.24  plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced
659.25  from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath
659.26  Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin
659.27  cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex
659.28  of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in
659.29  the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner
659.30  as to facilitate total combustion.</p>
659.31  
659.32  <p>What followed this operation?</p>
659.33  <p>That truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted
659.34  a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.</p>
659.35  
659.36  <p>What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
659.37  mantelpiece?</p>
660.01  <p>A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of
660.02  4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon:
660.03  a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under at ransparent bellshade, matrimonial
660.04  gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
660.05  Alderman John Hooper.</p>
660.06  
660.07  <p>What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
660.08  Bloom?</p>
660.09  <p>In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
660.10  dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror
660.11  the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise
660.12  bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with
660.13  obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the
660.14  matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.</p>
660.15  
660.16  <p>What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
660.17  attention?</p>
660.18  <p>The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.</p>
660.19  
660.20  <p>Why solitary (ipsorelative)?</p>
660.21  <p><i>Brothers and sisters had he none.</i></p>
660.22  <p><i>Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.</i></p>
660.23  
660.24  <p>Why mutable (aliorelative)?</p>
660.25  <p>From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
660.26  From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
660.27  procreator.</p>
660.28  
660.29  <p>What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?</p>
660.30  <p>The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
660.31  and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two
660.32  bookshelves opposite.</p>
660.33

662.13  county Wicklow, the fineſt place in the world.</p>
662.14  
662.15  <p>What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the
662.16  inverted volumes?</p>
662.17  <p>The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place:
662.18  the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity
662.19  of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool:
662.20  the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the
662.21  pages of a book.</p>
662.22  
662.23  <p>Which volume was the largest in bulk?</p>
662.24  <p>Hozier's <i>History of the Russo-Turkish War</i>.</p>
662.25  
662.26  <p>What among other data did the second volume of the work in question
662.27  contain?</p>
662.28  <p>The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
662.29  decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).</p>
662.30  
662.31  <p>Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?</p>
662.32  <p>Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
662.33  interval of amnesia, when seated at the central table, about to consult the work
663.01  in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military
663.02  engagement, Plevna.</p>
663.03  
663.04  <p>What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?</p>
663.05  <p>The candour, nudity, pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
663.06  statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by
663.07  auction from P.A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.</p>
663.08  
663.09  <p>What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?</p>
663.10  <p>Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two
663.11  articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to
663.12  alterations of mass by expansion.</p>
663.13  
663.14  <p>How was the irritation allayed?</p>
663.15  <p>He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud,
663.16  from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively
663.17  in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of
663.18  irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the
663.19  pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle
663.20  along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae,
663.21  thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described
663.22  about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary
663.23  prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser
663.24  buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.</p>
663.25  
663.26  <p>What involuntary actions followed?</p>
663.27  <p>He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in
663.28  the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted
663.29  2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched
663.30  imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points
663.31  and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand
663.32  into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver
663.33  coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (10 October 1903)
663.34  of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.</p>

664.26  
664.27  <p>Did the process of divestiture continue?</p>
664.28  <p>Sensible of a benignant persistant ache in his footsoles he extended his
664.29  foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points
664.30  caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different
664.31  directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the
664.32  laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially
664.33  moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe
664.34  had again effracted, raised his right and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock
664.35  suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin
664.36  of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of
664.37  the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour
664.38  of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguial fragment.</p>
664.39  
665.01  <p>Why with satisfaction?</p>
665.02  <p>Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
665.03  unguial fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's
665.04  juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and
665.05  nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.</p>
665.06  
665.07  <p>In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions
665.08  now coalesced?</p>
665.09  <p>Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or
665.10  possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of acres, roods
665.11  and perches, statute land measure (valuation £ 42), of grazing turbary
665.12  surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage drive nor, on the other
665.13  hand, a terracehouse or semidetached villa, described as <i>Rus in Urbe</i> or <i>Qui Si

667.32  ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested
667.33  river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches

668.05  <p>Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?</p>
668.06  <p>Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and
668.07  requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc.</p>
668.08  
668.09  <p>What would be his civic functions and social status among the county
668.10  families and landed gentry?</p>
668.11  <p>Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of
668.12  gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career,
668.13  resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of
668.14  arms and appropriate classical moto (<i>Semper paratus</i>), duly recorded in the
668.15  court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M.P., P.C., K.P., L.L.D. <i>honoris causa</i>,
668.16  Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence
668.17  (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).</p>
668.18  
668.19  <p>What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?</p>
668.20  <p>A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the
668.21  dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly
668.22  rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed
668.23  homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest
668.24  possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of
668.25  estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power
668.26  in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict
668.27  maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all
668.28  simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary
668.29  solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution) the upholding of
668.30  the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers
668.31  in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all
668.32  resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights,
668.33  obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution,
668.34  all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic
668.35  conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.</p>
668.36  
669.01  <p>Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth?</p>
669.02  <p>To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his
669.03  disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father
669.04  Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic
669.05  faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity
669.06  among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism
669.07  at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane
669.08  and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the
669.09  premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal
669.10  perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion
669.11  and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in <i>The Descent of
669.12  Man</i> and <i>The Origin of Species</i>. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence
669.13  to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan
669.14  Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J.F.X. O'Brien and others, the
669.15  agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles
669.16  Stewart Parnell (M.P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment
669.17  and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M.P. for Midlothian, N.B.)
669.18  and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a
669.19  secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road
669.20  to see the entrance (2 Febuary 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative
669.21  torchlight procession of 20.000 torchbearers, divided into 120 trade
669.22  corporations, bearing 2.000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and
669.23  John Morley.</p>
669.24  
669.25  <p>How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?</p>
669.26  <p>As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised
669.27  Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum
669.28  of £ 60 par annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from giltedged
669.29  securities, representing at 5 | simple interest on capital of £ 1.200 (estimate
669.30  of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3 to be paid on acquisition and
669.31  the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. £ 800 plus 2 1/2 | interest
669.32  on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until
669.33  extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of
669.34  20 years, amounting to an annual rental of £ 64, headrent included, the
669.35  titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause
669.36  envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of
669.37  protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become
670.01  the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years
670.02  stipulated.</p>
670.03  
670.04  <p>What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate
670.05  purchase?</p>
670.06  <p>A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system
670.07  the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more
670.08  miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m.
670.09  at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting
670.10  purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time). The unexpected discovery
670.11  of an object of great monetary value (precious stone, valuable adhesive or
670.12  unpressed posrage stamps (7 shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866:
670.13  4 pence, rose, blue paper, perforate, Great Britain, 1855: 1 franc, stone,
670.14  official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxemburg, 1878, antique dynastical
670.15  ring, unique relic) in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from
670.16  the air (dropped by an eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised
670.17  remains of an incendiated edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan
670.18  and derelict), on earth (in the gizzard of a commestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's
670.19  donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged
670.20  with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5 | compound
670.21  interest of the collective worth of £ 5.000.000 stg (five million pounds
670.22  sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32
670.23  consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on
670.24  delivery at the initial rate of 1/4 d. to be increased constantly in the
670.25  geometrical progression of 2 (1/4, 1/2, 1 d., 2 d., 4 d., 8 d., 1 s. 4 d., 2 s. 8 d.
670.26  to 32 terms). A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to
670.27  break the bank at Monte Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the
670.28  quadrature of the circle, government premium £ 1.000.000 sterling.</p>
670.29  
670.30  <p>Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?</p>
670.31  <p>The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the
670.32  prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 15, by the
670.33  cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. The
670.34  utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing
670.35  chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast
670.36  number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human
670.37  being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts
671.01  of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed animal and vegetable diet), to be
671.02  multiplied by 4.386.035 the total population of Ireland according the census
671.03  returns of 1901.</p>
671.04  
671.05  <p>Were there schemes of wider scope?</p>
671.06  <p>A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour
671.07  commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power), obtained by
671.08  hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca
671.09  or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production
671.10  of 500.000 W.H.P. of electricity. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta
671.11  of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used
671.12  for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths,
671.13  shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for
671.14  mixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the
671.15  delivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish
671.16  tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats,
671.17  plying in the fluvial fairway between Island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs,
671.18  narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation
671.19  [10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included]. A scheme for the
671.20  repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed
671.21  from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North
671.22  Circular road and Prussia Street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower and East
671.23  Wall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with the Great
671.24  Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park, Liffey junction,
671.25  and terminus of Midland Great Western railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in
671.26  proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway,

671.35  rolling stock for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the
671.36  Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.</p>
671.37  
672.01  <p>Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes
672.02  become a natural and necessary apodosis?</p>
672.03  <p>Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift
672.04  and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest after donor's
672.05  painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim,
672.06  Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures,
672.07  amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the
672.08  thing required was done.</p>
672.09  
672.10  <p>What eventually would render him independent of such wealth?</p>
672.11  <p>The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.</p>
672.12  
672.13  <p>For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?</p>
672.14  <p>It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation
672.15  to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past
672.16  when practised habitually before retiring for the night allievated fatigue and
672.17  produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.</p>
672.18  
672.19  <p>His justifications?</p>
672.20  <p>As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life
672.21  at least 2/7, viz., 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew that at the
672.22  termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires
672.23  has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of
672.24  malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.</p>
672.25  
672.26  <p>What did he fear?</p>
672.27  <p>The commital of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the
672.28  light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the
672.29  cerebral convolutions.</p>
672.30  
672.31  <p>What were habitually his final meditations?</p>
672.32  <p>Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonders
672.33  a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its
672.34  simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and
672.35  congruous with the velocity of modern life.</p>
672.36  
673.01  <p>What did the first drawer unlocked contain?</p>
673.02  <p>A Vere Foster's handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent) Bloom,

674.23  city man, hospital nurse, lady, mother of five, absentminded beggar.</p>
674.24  
674.25  <p>How did absentminded beggar's concluding testimonial conclude?</p>
674.26  <p>What a pity the government did not supply our men with wonderworkers
674.27  during the South African campaign! What a relief it would have been!</p>
674.28  
674.29  <p>What object did Bloom add to this collection of objects?</p>
674.30  <p>A 4th typewritten letter received by Henry Flower (let H.F. be L.B.)
674.31  from Martha Clifford (find M.C.)</p>
674.32  
674.33  <p>What pleasant reflection accompanied this action?</p>
674.34  <p>The reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic face,
674.35  form and address had been favourably received during the course of the
674.36  preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie Powell); a nurse,
674.37  Miss Callan (Christian name unknown) a maid, Gertrude (Gerty, family name
674.38  unkown).</p>
674.39  
675.01  <p>What possibility suggested itself?</p>
675.02  <p>The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the most
675.03  immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in the
675.04  company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately mercenary,
675.05  variously instructed, a lady by origin.</p>
675.06  
675.07  <p>What did the 2nd drawer contain?</p>
675.08  <p>Documents: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment

675.20  change of name by deedpoll.</p>
675.21  
675.22  <p>Quote the textual terms of this notice.</p>
675.23  <p>I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at n° 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
675.24  formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that
675.25  I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be
675.26  known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.</p>
675.27  
675.28  <p>What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the
675.29  2nd drawer?</p>
675.30  <p>An indistinct daguerrotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold
675.31  Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively)
675.32  1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah
675.33  book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the
675.34  passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard
675.35  of the Queen's Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed:
675.36  <i>To My Dear Son Leopold</i>.</p>
675.37  
676.01  <p>What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those four whole words
676.02  evoke?</p>
676.03  <p>Tomorrow will be a week that I received ... it is no use Leopold to be ...
676.04  wlth your dear mother ... that is not more to stand ... to her ... all for me is
676.05  out ... be kind to Athos, Leopold ... my dear son ... always ... of me ... <i>das
676.06  Herz</i> ... <i>Gott</i> ... <i>dein</i> ...</p>
676.07  
676.08  <p>What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive
676.09  melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?</p>
676.10  <p>An old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing:
676.11  an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and
676.12  scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a
676.13  septuagenarian suicide by poison.</p>
676.14  
676.15  <p>Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?</p>
676.16  <p>Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
676.17  beliefs and practices.</p>
676.18  
676.19  <p>As?</p>
676.20  <p>The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the
676.21  hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
676.22  mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants:
676.23  the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the
676.24  tetragrammation: the sanctity of the sabbath.</p>
676.25  
676.26  <p>How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?</p>
676.27  <p>Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
676.28  other beliefs and practices now appeared.</p>
676.29  
676.30  <p>What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?</p>
676.31  <p>Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
676.32  retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin,
676.33  London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements
676.34  of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria,
676.35  queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the
676.36  pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had
676.37  accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map
677.01  of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated
677.02  business premises in the various centres mentioned.</p>
677.03  
677.04  <p>Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
677.05  migrations in narrator and listener?</p>
677.06  <p>In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
677.07  narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the
677.08  action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.</p>
677.09  
677.10  <p>What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
677.11  amnesia?</p>
677.12  <p>Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
677.13  Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of grooseberry fool from an inclined
677.14  plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a
677.15  lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.</p>
677.16  
677.17  <p>What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?</p>
677.18  <p>The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
677.19  repletion.</p>
677.20  
677.21  <p>What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?</p>
677.22  <p>The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession
677.23  of scrip.</p>
677.24  
677.25  <p>Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
677.26  these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a
677.27  negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.</p>
677.28  <p>Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
677.29  hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful
677.30  debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent
677.31  bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4 d in the £, sandwichman, distributor
677.32  of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind
677.33  stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank,
677.34  eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under
677.35  discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House
677.36  (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced
677.37  but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of
678.01  misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
678.02  pauper.</p>
678.03  
678.04  <p>With which attendant indignities?</p>
678.05  <p>The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt
678.06  of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated
678.07  ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed
678.08  vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth
678.09  little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.</p>
678.10  
678.11  <p>By what could such a situation be precluded?</p>
678.12  <p>By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).</p>
678.13  
678.14  <p>Which preferably?</p>
678.15  <p>The latter, by the line of least resistance.</p>
678.16  
678.17  <p>What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?</p>
678.18  <p>Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The
678.19  habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to
678.20  counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.</p>
678.21  
678.22  <p>What considerations rendered it not irrational?</p>
678.23  <p>The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being
678.24  done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited
678.25  were obliged to reunite, for increase and multiplication which was absurd, to
678.26  form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.</p>
678.27  
678.28  <p>What considerations rendered it desirable?</p>
678.29  <p>The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as
678.30  represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special
678.31  ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.</p>
678.32  
678.33  <p>In Ireland?</p>
678.34  <p>The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with
678.35  submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle,
678.36  the Golden Vale of Tiperrary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath,
678.37  Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon
678.38  Leap, the lakes of Killarney.</p>
678.39  
679.01  <p>Abroad?</p>
679.02  <p>Ceylon, (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for
679.03  Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E.C, 5 Dame Street,
679.04  Dublin), Jerusalem, tbe holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of
679.05  Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace
679.06  of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian
679.07  divinities) the Wall street money market (which controlled international
679.08  finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the Camerons
679.09  had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with
679.10  impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country
679.11  of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which
679.12  was to die), the Dead Sea.</p>
679.13  
679.14  <p>Under what guidance, following what signs?</p>
679.15  <p>At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of
679.16  intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and
679.17  divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle
679.18  formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa
679.19  Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, reveated in imperfect varying
679.20  phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded
679.21  skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.</p>
679.22  
679.23  <p>What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?</p>
679.24  <p>£ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,
679.25  missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom Leopold (Poldy),
679.26  height 5 ft., 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown
679.27  a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for
679.28  information leading to his discovery.</p>
679.29  
679.30  <p>What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and
679.31  nonentity?</p>
679.32  <p>Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.</p>
679.33  
679.34  <p>What tributes his?</p>
679.35  <p>Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal,
679.36  beauty, the bride of Noman.</p>
679.37  
680.01  <p>Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?</p>
680.02  <p>Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary
680.03  orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical
680.04  waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land,
680.05  among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly hea would her and
680.06  somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence,
680.07  disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow
680.08  reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable
680.09  eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on
680.10  malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by
680.11  supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.</p>
680.12  
680.13  <p>What would render such return irrational?</p>
680.14  <p>An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
680.15  reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.</p>
680.16  
680.17  <p>What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?</p>
680.18  <p>The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the
680.19  night, rendering invisible the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous
680.20  the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed,
680.21  obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness
680.22  (linen) obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound
680.23  without echo, desired desire.</p>
680.24  
680.25  <p>What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
680.26  unoccupied bed?</p>
680.27  <p>The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature
680.28  female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal
680.29  contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers
680.30  accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped)
680.31  and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).</p>
680.32  
680.33  <p>What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated
680.34  fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?</p>
680.35  <p>The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and
680.36  premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral
680.37  (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and
681.01  Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the visit to
681.02  museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row,
681.03  Merchants Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the
681.04  Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in
681.05  Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a
681.06  cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the
681.07  eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged
681.08  delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly
681.09  house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl
681.10  and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation
681.11  to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).</p>
681.12  
681.13  <p>What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as
681.14  to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?</p>
681.15  <p>The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the
681.16  insentient material of a strainveined timber table.</p>
681.17  
681.18  <p>What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured
681.19  multiform mutitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?</p>
681.20  <p>Who was M'Intosh?</p>
681.21  
681.22  <p>What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30
681.23  years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction
681.24  of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?</p>
681.25  <p>Where was Moses when the candle went out?</p>
681.26  
681.27  <p>What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently,
681.28  successively, enumerate?</p>
681.29  <p>A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a
681.30  certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson
681.31  and C°, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.C.), to certify
681.32  the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female
681.33  divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of <i>Leah</i>
681.34  by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King
681.35  street.</p>
681.36  
682.01  <p>What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?</p>
682.02  <p>The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal
682.03  Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.</p>
682.04  
682.05  <p>What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?</p>
682.06  <p>Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street,
682.07  with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if
682.08  produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant
682.09  uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Nothern Railway Amiens
682.10  street, returning.</p>
682.11  
682.12  <p>What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
682.13  perceived by him?</p>
682.14  <p>A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new
682.15  violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous
682.16  lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and
682.17  containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of batiste
682.18  with thin lace border, a accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these
682.19  objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple
682.20  battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its
682.21  fore side in white lettering B.C.T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).</p>
682.22  
682.23  <p>What impersonal objects were perceived?</p>
682.24  <p>A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting,
682.25  apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware,
682.26  bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery
682.27  manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore Street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and
682.28  floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand,
682.29  together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).</p>
682.30  
682.31  <p>Bloom's acts?</p>
682.32  <p>He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles
682.33  of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long
682.34  white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the
682.35  nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared
682.36  the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.</p>
682.37  
683.01  <p>How?</p>
683.02  <p>With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
683.03  not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old,
683.04  the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and
683.05  strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the
683.06  less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation
683.07  of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.</p>
683.08  
683.09  <p>What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?</p>
683.10  <p>New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
683.11  female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some
683.12  flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.</p>
683.13  
683.14  <p>If he had smiled why would he have smiled?</p>
683.15  <p>To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter
683.16  whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term
683.17  of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone
683.18  whereas, he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating
683.19  in and repeated to infinity.</p>
683.20  
683.21  <p>What preceding series?</p>
683.22  <p>Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy,
683.23  professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard
683.24  Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly,
683.25  Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher
683.26  Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the
683.27  Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke,
683.28  Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady,
683.29  Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office,
683.30  Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.</p>
683.31  
683.32  <p>What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late
683.33  occupant of the bed?</p>
683.34  <p>Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker),
683.35  commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).</p>
683.36  
684.01  <p>Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
684.02  proportion and commercial ability?</p>
684.03  <p>Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
684.04  members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted
684.05  first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with
684.06  fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.</p>
684.07  
684.08  <p>With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
684.09  affected?</p>
684.10  <p>Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.</p>
684.11  
684.12  <p>Envy?</p>
684.13  <p>Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
684.14  superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston
684.15  and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant
684.16  but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism,
684.17  passive but not obtuse.</p>
684.18  
684.19  <p>Jealousy?</p>
684.20  <p>Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the
684.21  agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agents and reagents
684.22  at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with
684.23  incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled
684.24  contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation
684.25  of pleasure.</p>
684.26  
684.27  <p>Abnegation?</p>
684.28  <p>In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
684.29  establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay,
684.30  b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated
684.31  in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and
684.32  magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction,
684.33  intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical
684.34  tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.</p>
684.35  
684.36  <p>Equanimity?</p>
684.37  <p>As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
684.38  understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with
685.01  his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous
685.02  as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a
685.03  dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children
685.04  and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,
685.05  misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering,
685.06  mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court,
685.07  arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking,
685.08  practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury,
685.09  poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal
685.10  assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal
685.11  than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,
685.12  resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its
685.13  attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations,
685.14  significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.</p>
685.15  
685.16  <p>Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?</p>
685.17  <p>From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
685.18  outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
685.19  violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously
685.20  violated.</p>
685.21  
685.22  <p>What retribution, if any?</p>
685.23  <p>Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by
685.24  combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic
685.25  bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit for
685.26  damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries
685.27  sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance,
685.28  introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity:
685.29  moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,
685.30  humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting
685.31  separator from both.</p>
685.32  
685.33  <p>By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
685.34  incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?</p>
685.35  <p>The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility
685.36  of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the
685.37  selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating
686.01  relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female,
686.02  the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural
686.03  grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an
686.04  aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onoma-
686.05  topœic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into
686.06  its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary
686.07  verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopœic past participle with complementary
686.08  masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by
686.09  generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of
686.10  triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy
686.11  of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.</p>
686.12  
686.13  <p>In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections
686.14  reduced to their simplest forms, converge?</p>
686.15  <p>Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres,
686.16  in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the
686.17  midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of
686.18  promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and
686.19  honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular
686.20  families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of
686.21  contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.</p>
686.22  
686.23  <p>The visible signs of antesatisfaction?</p>
686.24  <p>An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
686.25  tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.</p>
686.26  
686.27  <p>Then?</p>
686.28  <p>He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on
686.29  each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure
686.30  prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.</p>
686.31  
686.32  <p>The visible signs of postsatisfaction?</p>
686.33  <p>A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
686.34  solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.</p>
686.35  
686.36  <p>What followed this silent action?</p>
686.37  <p>Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
686.38  catechetical interrogation.</p>
686.39  
687.01  <p>With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?</p>
687.02  <p>Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
687.03  Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the
687.04  vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and C°, Limited, 8, 9 and
687.05  10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by
687.06  the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he
687.07  included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of <i>Leah</i> at the
687.08  Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at
687.09  Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel 35, 36 and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of
687.10  peccaminous pornographical tendency entituled <i>Sweets of Sin,</i> anonymous,
687.11  author a gentlemen of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely
687.12  calculated movement in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim
687.13  (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,
687.14  eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical
687.15  feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and
687.16  author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.</p>
687.17  
687.18  <p>Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?</p>
687.19  <p>Absolutely.</p>
687.20  
687.21  <p>Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?</p>
687.22  <p>Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.</p>
687.23  
687.24  <p>What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
687.25  perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of
687.26  this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?</p>
687.27  <p>By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
687.28  celebrated 2 calendar months after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
687.29  September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with
687.30  female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on
687.31  the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with
687.32  ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place
687.33  5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893
687.34  of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1895, aged 11 days, there
687.35  remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal
687.36  intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the
687.37  natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and
688.01  corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the
688.02  listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by
688.03  catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15
688.04  September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which
688.05  in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension
688.06  between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal
688.07  liberty of action had been circumscribed.</p>
688.08  
688.09  <p>How?</p>
688.10  <p>By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
688.11  destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for
688.12  which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or
688.13  effected.</p>
688.14  
688.15  <p>What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible
688.16  thoughts?</p>
688.17  <p>The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric
688.18  circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.</p>
688.19  
688.20  <p>In what directions did listener and narrator lie?</p>
688.21  <p>Listener: S.E. by E.: Narrator N.W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of
688.22  latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to the
688.23  terrestrial equator.</p>
688.24  
688.25  <p>In what state of rest or motion?</p>
688.26  <p>At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and
688.27  both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper
688.28  perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging
688.29  space.</p>
688.30  
688.31  <p>In what posture?</p>
688.32  <p>Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
688.33  extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of
688.34  Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left,
688.35  with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting
688.36  on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph
688.37  made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.</p>
688.38  
689.01  <p>Womb? Weary?</p>
689.02  <p>He rests. He has travelled.</p>
689.03  
689.04  <p>With?</p>
689.05  <p>Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and
689.06  Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad
689.07  the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer
689.08  and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and
689.09  Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.</p>
689.10  
689.11  <p>When?</p>
689.12  <p>Going to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's
689.13  eggin the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the
689.14  Brightdayler.</p>
689.15  
689.16  <p>Where?</p>
689.17  <p>●</p>
