37.01  <p>Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through
37.02  my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack,
37.03  the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.
37.04  Limits of the diaphane But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them
37.05  bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them,
37.06  sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, <i>maestro di color che sanno.</i>
37.07  Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can
37.08  put your five fingers throught it, it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes
37.09  and see.</p>
37.10  <p>Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
37.11  shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A
37.12  very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six: the
37.13  <i>nacheinander</i>. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.
37.14  Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o'er his base, fell
37.15  through the <i>nebeneinander</i> ineluctably. I am getting on nicely in the dark. My
37.16  ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with it: they do. My two feet in his boots
37.17  are at the end of his legs, <i>nebeneinander</i>. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of
37.18  <i>Los Demiurgos.</i> Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush,
37.19  crack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominic Deasy kens them a'.</p>
37.20  <p><i>Won't you come to Sandymount,</i></p>
37.21  <p><i>Madeline the mare?</i></p>
37.22  <p>Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs march ing.
37.23  No, agallop: <i>deline the mare</i>.</p>
38.01  <p>Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I
38.02  open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. <i>Basta!</i> I will see if I can see.</p>
38.03  <p>See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
38.04  without end.</p>
38.05  <p>They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently, <i>Frauenzim-//mer:</i>
38.06  and down the shelving shore flabbily their splayed feet sinking in the
38.07  silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother. Number
38.08  one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in the beach.
38.09  From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late
38.10  Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged
38.11  me squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A
38.12  misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all
38.13  link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will
38.14  you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to
38.15  Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.</p>
38.16  <p>Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no
38.17  navel. Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,
38.18  whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to ever-//lasting.
38.19  Womb of sin.</p>
38.20  <p>Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man
38.21  with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.
38.22  They clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the ages He
38.23  willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A <i>lex eterna</i> stays about
38.24  Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consub-//stantial?
38.25  Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring his life long
38.26  on the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred heresiarch. In a Greek
38.27  watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. With beaded mitre and with
38.28  crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed
38.29  omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.</p>
38.30  <p>Airs romped around him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.
38.31  The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
38.32  Mananaan.</p>
38.33  <p>I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half twelve.
38.34  By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile. Yes, I
38.35  must.</p>
38.36  <p>His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to Aunt Sara's or not? My
38.37  consubstantial father's voice. Did you see anything of your artist brother
39.01  Stephen lately? No? Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt
39.02  Sally? Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and and tell us
39.03  Stephen, how is uncle Si? O weeping God, the things I married into. De
39.04  boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the
39.05  cornet player. Highly respectable gondoliers. And skeweyed Walter sirring
39.06  his father, no less. Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ.</p>
39.07  <p>I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take me
39.08  for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.</p>
39.09  <p>--It's Stephen, sir.</p>
39.10  <p>--Let him in. Let Stephen in.</p>
39.11  <p>A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.</p>
39.12  <p>--We thought you were someone else.</p>
39.13  <p>In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the
39.14  hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the upper
39.15  moiety.</p>
39.16  <p>--Morrow, nephew.</p>
39.17  <p>He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes
39.18  of Master Goff and Master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common
39.19  searches and a writ of <i>Duces Tecum</i>. A bogoak frame over his bald head:
39.20  Wilde's <i>Requiescat</i>. The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.</p>
39.21  <p>--Yes, sir?</p>
39.22  <p>--Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?</p>
39.23  <p>--Bathing Crissie, sir.</p>
39.24  <p>Papa's little bedpal. Lump of love.</p>
39.25  <p>--No, uncle Richie ...</p>
39.26  <p>--Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!</p>
39.27  <p>--Uncle Richie, really ...</p>
39.28  <p>--Sit down or by the law. Harry I'll knock you down.</p>
39.29  <p>Walter squints vainly for a chair.</p>
39.30  <p>--He has nothing to sit down on, sir.</p>
39.31  <p>--He has nowhere  put toit, you mug. Bring in our Chippendale chair.
39.32  Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
39.33  here; the rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the better.
39.34  We have nothing in the house but backache pills.</p>
39.35  <p><i>All'erta!</i></p>
39.36  <p>He drones bars of Ferrando's <i>aria di sortita</i>. The grandest number, Stephen,
39.37  in the whole opera. Listen.</p>
40.01  <p>His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his
40.02  fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.</p>
40.03  <p>This wind is sweeter.</p>
40.04  <p>Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you
40.05  had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them,
40.06  Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay, of Marsh's library
40.07  where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The
40.08  hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from them
40.09  to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.
40.10  Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan,
40.11  Foxy Campbell, Lantern jaws. Abbas father, furious dean what offence laid
40.12  fire to their brains? Paff! <i>Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris.</i> A garland of
40.13  grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the
40.14  footpace <i>(descende),</i> clutching a monstrance, basliskeyed. Get down, bald poll!
40.15  A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar's horns, the
40.16  snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and
40.17  gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.</p>
40.18  <p>And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.
40.19  Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. Dringadring!
40.20  And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek. Dringdring!
40.21  Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor. A
40.22  misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain. Bringing his host
40.23  down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the
40.24  transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two
40.25  bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.</p>
40.26  <p>Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully
40.27  holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have
40.28  a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy
40.29  widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street. <i>O si,
40.30  certo!</i> Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw. More tell
40.31  me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: <i>naked
40.32  women!</i>  What about that, eh?</p>
40.33  <p>What about what? what else were they invented for?</p>
40.34  <p>Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.
40.35  You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly,
40.36  striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-
40.37  one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Have you read his
41.01  F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O yes, W. Remember
41.02  your epiphanies  on green oval leaves, deeeply deep, copies to be sent if you
41.03  died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone
41.04  was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico
41.05  della Mirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange
41.06  pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once ...</p>
41.07  <p>The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a
41.08  damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered
41.09  pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome
41.10  sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath.  He
41.11  coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in
41.12  the cakey sand dough. A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the
41.13  shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled
41.14  backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ring-//send:
41.15  wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.</p>
41.16  <p>He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there?
41.17  Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand
41.18  towards the Pigeonhouse.</p>
41.19  <p>--<i>Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?</i></p>
41.20  <p>--<i>C'est le pigeon, Joseph.</i></p>
41.21  <p>Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar Mac-//Mahon.
41.22  Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a bird, he
41.23  lapped the sweet <i>lait chaud</i> with pink young tongue, plump bunny's face. Lap,
41.24  <i>lapin</i>. He hopes to win in the <i>gros lots</i>. About the nature of women he read
41.25  in Michelet. But he must send me <i>La Vie de Jésus</i> by M. Léo Taxil. Lent it to
41.26  his friend.</p>
41.27  <p>--<i>C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas en l'exis-//tence
41.28  de Dieu. Faut pas le dire à mon père.</i></p>
41.29  <p>--<i>Il croit?</i></p>
41.30  <p>--<i>Mon père, oui.</i></p>
41.31  <p><i>Schluss.</i> He laps.</p>
41.32  <p>My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want
41.33  puce gloves. You were a student, weren't you? Of what in the other devil's
41.34  name? Paysayenn. P.C.N., you know: <i>physiques, chimiques et naturelles</i>. Aha.
41.35  Eating your groatsworth of <i>mou en civet,</i> fleshpots of Egypt, elbowed by belching
41.36  cabmen. Just say in the most natural tone: when I was in Paris, <i>boul' Mich',</i> I
41.37  used to. Yes, used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested
42.01  you for murder somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of
42.02  February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it:
42.03  other me. Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. <i>Lui, c'est moi.</i> You seem to have enjoyed
42.04  yourself.</p>
42.05  <p>Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a dispos-//sessed.
42.06  With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging door of the post
42.07  office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger toothache. <i>Encore deux minutes.</i>
42.08  Look clock. Must get. <i>Fermé.</i> Hired dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang
42.09  shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place
42.10  clack back. Not hurt? O, that's all right. Shake hands. See what I meant,
42.11  see? O, that's all right. Shake a shake. O, that's all only all right.</p>
42.12  <p>You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery
42.13  Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their
42.14  pintpots, loudlatinlanghing: <i>Euge! Euge!</i> Pretending to speak broken English
42.15  as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the slimy pier at Newhaven.
42.16  <i>Comment?</i> Rich booty you brought back; <i>Le Tutu</i>, five tattered numbers of
42.17  <i>Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge,</i> a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:</p>
42.18  <p>--Mother dying come home father.</p>
42.19  <p>The aunt thinks you killed your mother. That's why she won't.</p>
42.20  <p><i>Then here's a health to Mulligan's aunt</i></p>
42.21  <p><i>And I'll tell you the reason why.</i></p>
42.22  <p><i>She always kept things decent in</i></p>
42.23  <p><i>The Hannigan famileye.</i></p>
42.24  <p>His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along
42.25  by the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone
42.26  mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is there,
42.27  the slender trees, the lemon houses.</p>
42.28  <p>Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of
42.29  farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the air.
42.30  Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the kerchiefed housewife
42.31  is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hands. In Rodot's Yvonne and Madeleine
42.32  newmake there tumbled beauties, shattering with gold teeth <i>chaussons</i> of
42.33  pastry, their mouths yellowed with the <i>pus</i> of <i>flan bréton</i>. Faces of Paris men
42.34  go by, their well pleased pleasers, curled conquistadores.</p>
43.01  <p>Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers
43.02  smeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white. About
43.03  us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. <i>Un demi sétier</i>! A jet of coffee
43.04  steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me at his beck. <i>Il est Irlandais.
43.05  Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux Irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez? Ah, oui!</i>
43.06  She thought you wanted a cheese <i>hollandais</i>. Your postprandial, do you know
43.07  that word? Postprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona,
43.08  queer fellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: <i>slainte!</i> Around
43.09  the slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His
43.10  breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang thrusting
43.11  between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur
43.12  Griffith now.  To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause.
43.13  You're your father's son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered,
43.14  trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist,
43.15  Drumont, know what he called queen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow
43.16  teeth. <i>Vieille ogresse</i> with the <i>dents jaunes</i>. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, <i>La
43.17  Patrie,</i> M. Millevoye, Félix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The
43.18  froeken, <i>bonne à tout faire,</i> who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala.
43.19  <i>Moi faire,</i> she said. <i>Tous les messieurs</i> not this <i>Monsieur</i>, I said. Most licentious
43.20  custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let my brother, not even my
43.21  own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I see you. Fang, I feel.
43.22  Lascivious people.</p>
43.23  <p>The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose tobacco
43.24  shreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw facebones
43.25  under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got away, authentic
43.26  version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil orangeblossoms, drove out the
43.27  road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.
43.28  Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.</p>
43.29  <p>Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you,
43.30  I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love he prowled
43.31  with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of Clerkenwell
43.32  and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog. Shatte-//red
43.33  glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought
43.34  by any save by me. Making his day's stations, the dingy printingcase, his three
43.35  taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or,
43.36  damascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless, wifeless. She
43.37  is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame, in rue Gît-le-Cœur,
44.01  canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young
44.02  thing's. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat you saw me, won't you? I wanted
44.03  to get poor Pat a job one time. <i>Mon fils,</i> soldier of France. I taught him to
44.04  sing. <i>The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades</i>. Know that old lay? I taught
44.05  Patrice that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore.
44.06  Goes like this. <i>O, O.</i> He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.</p>
44.07  <p><i>O, O the boys of</i></p>
44.08  <p><i>Kilkenny</i> ...</p>
44.09  <p>Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he
44.10  them. Remembering thee, O Sion.</p>
44.11  <p>He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.
44.12  The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of
44.13  brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I? He stood
44.14  suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back.</p>
44.15  <p>Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new
44.16  sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans the
44.17  shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping
44.18  duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In the dark-//ness
44.19  of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around
44.20  a board of abandoned platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep
44.21  there when this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower entombing their
44.22  blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his
44.23  feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all, keep
44.24  all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon's midwatches I
44.25  pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore's tempting
44.26  flood.</p>
44.27  <p>The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back
44.28  then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge and
44.29  eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.</p>
44.30  <p>A bloated carcase of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the gun-//wale
44.31  of a boat, sunk in sand. <i>Un coche ensablé</i>, Louis Veuillot called Gautier's
44.32  prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here. And
44.33  there, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats. Hide gold there.
44.34  Try it You have some. Sands and stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys.
44.35  Mind you don't get one bang on the ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all
45.01  them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz
45.02  de bloodz odz an Iridzman.</p>
45.03  <p>A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.
45.04  Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of
45.05  others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away, walking
45.06  shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two maries. They
45.07  have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog.
45.08  He is running back to them. Who?</p>
45.09  <p>Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their blood-//beaked
45.10  prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of
45.11  tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A
45.12  school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the
45.13  shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my
45.14  people, with flayers' knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery
45.15  whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts
45.16  my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling,
45.17  among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.</p>
45.18  <p>The dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I
45.19  just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. <i>Terribilia meditans.</i> A primrose
45.20  doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you pining, the bark
45.21  of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The Bruce's brother, Thomas
45.22  Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York's false scion, in breeches of
45.23  silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of
45.24  nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned. All kings' sons. Paradise of pretenders
45.25  then and now. He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping.
45.26  But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own
45.27  house. House of ... We don't want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would
45.28  you do what he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. <i>Natürlich,</i> put there
45.29  for you. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine
45.30  days ago off Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it
45.31  out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold
45.32  soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! who's
45.33  behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on
45.34  all sides, sheeting the lows of sands quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land
45.35  under my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning
45.36  man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. I ... With
45.37  him together down ... I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.</p>
46.01  <p>A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.</p>
46.02  <p>Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
46.03  all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off
46.04  like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming
46.05  gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded
46.06  back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck,
46.07  trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff
46.08  forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds
46.09  of seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many
46.10  crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves
46.11  and waves.</p>
46.12  <p>Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused
46.13  their bags, and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to
46.14  them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at
46.15  them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came
46.16  towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from his jaws. His
46.17  speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf's gallop. The
46.18  carcase lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing
46.19  closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog's
46.20  bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great
46.21  goal. Ah, poor dogsbody. Here lies poor dogsbody's body.</p>
46.22  <p>--Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel.</p>
46.23  <p>The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
46.24  kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk
46.25  back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped,
46.26  dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.
46.27  He trotted forward and, lifting his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt
46.28  rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered  sand:
46.29  then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his
46.30  grandmother. He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen
46.31  to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a
46.32  pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.</p>
46.33  <p>After he woke me up last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open
46.34  hallway. Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it.
46.35  That man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against
46.36  my face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red
46.37  carpet spread. You will see who.</p>
47.01  <p>Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet out
47.02  of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling
47.03  his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his
47.04  strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her
47.05  bare feet. A bout her windraw face her hair trailed. Behind her lord his
47.06  helpmate, bing awast, to Romeville. When night hides her body's flaws calling
47.07  under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman
47.08  is treating two Royal Dublins in O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap
47.09  in rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell. A shefiend's whiteness
47.10  under her rancid rags. Fumbally's lane that night: the tanyard smells.</p>
47.11  <p><i>White thy fambles, red thy gan</i></p>
47.12  <p><i>And thy quarrons dainty is.</i></p>
47.13  <p><i>Couch a hogshead with me then.</i></p>
47.14  <p><i>In the darkmans clip and kiss.</i></p>
47.15  <p>Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, <i>frate porcospino</i>. Unfallen
47.16  Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: <i>thy quarrons dainty is</i>. Language
47.17  no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles:
47.18  roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.</p>
47.19  <p>Passing now.</p>
47.20  <p>A side-eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I
47.21  am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's flaming
47.22  sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains,
47.23  drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides,
47.24  myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, <i>oinopa ponton</i>, a winedark sea.
47.25  Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids
47.26  her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. <i>Omnis caro ad te
47.27  veniet.</i> He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying
47.28  the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.</p>
47.29  <p>Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.
47.30  No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.</p>
47.31  <p>His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her womb.
47.32  Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
47.33  ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayaway-//awayawayaway.
47.34  Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's letter. Here.
47.35  Thanking you for  hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the
48.01  sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words. That's twice I
48.02  forgot to take slips from the library counter.</p>
48.03  <p>His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till
48.04  the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in
48.05  the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his augur's rod
48.06  of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet
48.07  night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I throw this ended shadow from
48.08  me, manshape ineluctable, call it back. Endless, would it be mine, form of
48.09  my form? Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written
48.10  words? Signs on a white field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.
48.11  The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel
48.12  hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard.
48.13  Coloured on a flat: yes, that's right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,
48.14  flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now: Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.
48.15  Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is in our souls, do
48.16  you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us
48.17  yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.</p>
48.18  <p>She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the
48.19  blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of
48.20  the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
48.21  Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were
48.22  going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse of
48.23  her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park, with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of
48.24  letters. Talk that to some one else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those
48.25  curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.
48.26  Talk about apple dumplings, <i>piuttosto</i>. Where are your wits?</p>
48.27  <p>Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch
48.28  me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.
48.29  Sad too. Touch, touch me.</p>
48.30  <p>He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
48.31  note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. That is Kevin
48.32  Egan's movement I made nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. <i>Et vidit Deus.
48.33  Et erant valde bona.</i> Alo! <i>Bonjour</i>, welcome as the flowers in May. Under its
48.34  leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am
48.35  caught in this burning scene. Pan's hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy
48.36  serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.
48.37  Pain is far.</p>
49.01  <p><i>And no more turn aside and brood.</i></p>
49.02  <p>His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs <i>nebeneinander.</i>
49.03  He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another's foot had nested
49.04  warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove. But you
49.05  were delighted when Esther Osvalt's shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.
49.06  <i>Tiens, quel petit pied!</i> Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not
49.07  speak its name.  He now will leave me. And the blame? As I am. As I am. All
49.08  or not at all.</p>
49.09  <p>In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering green-//goldenly
49.10  lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away. I shall
49.11  wait. No, they will pass on, passing chafing against the low rocks, swirling,
49.12  passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourworded wavespeech:
49.13  seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss ooos. Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing
49.14  horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.
49.15  And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foam-//pool,
49.16  flower unfurling.</p>
49.17  <p>Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
49.18  sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying
49.19  and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded
49.20  and let fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose
49.21  heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their
49.22  times, <i>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</i>. To no end gathered: vainly
49.23  then released, forth flowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in
49.24  sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she
49.25  draws a toil of waters.</p>
49.26  <p>Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one he said.
49.27  Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose drift of
49.28  rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite from the
49.29  undertow, bobbing landward, a pace a pace a porpoise. There he is. Hook
49.30  it quick.  Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. We have him. Easy now.</p>
49.31  <p>Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a
49.32  spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God becomes
49.33  man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain. Dead
49.34  breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.
49.35  Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green
49.36  grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.</p>
49.37  <p>A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
50.01  known to man. Old Father Ocean. <i>Prix de Paris:</i> beware of imitations. Just you
50.02  give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.</p>
50.03  <p>Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
50.04  Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, <i>Lucifer,
50.05  dico, qui nescit occasum</i>. No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.
50.06  Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.</p>
50.07  <p>He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still. Yes,
50.08  evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end. By the
50.09  way next when is it? Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the glad new
50.10  year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.
50.11  <i>Già.</i> For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur Drumont, gentle-//man
50.12  journalist. <i>Già.</i> My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder? Feel. That one
50.13  is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?
50.14  That one.  Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it
50.15  mean something perhaps?</p>
50.16  <p>My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?</p>
50.17  <p>His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.</p>
50.18  <p>He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.
50.19  For the rest let look who will.</p>
50.20  <p>Behind. Perhaps there is someone.</p>
50.21  <p>He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the
50.22  air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing,
50.23  upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.</p>
