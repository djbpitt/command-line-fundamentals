690.01  <p>Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast
690.02  in bed with a couple of eggs since the <i>City Arms</i> hotel when he used to be
690.03  pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself
690.04  interesting to that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of
690.05  and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest
690.06  miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4 d for her methylated spirit telling me
690.07  all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes
690.08  and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world
690.09  if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of
690.10  course nobody wanted her to wear I suppose she was pious because no man
690.11  would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt
690.12  want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her
690.13  gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad
690.14  to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up
690.15  under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women
690.16  like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not
690.17  always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much
690.18  better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose
690.19  Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital
690.20  nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him
690.21  out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as
690.22  Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a
690.23  woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that
690.24  dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir
690.25  party at the sugarloof Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack
690.26  bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the
690.27  basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice
691.01  trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face
691.02  again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed
691.03  father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with
691.04  the razor paring his corns afraid hed get blood poisoning but if it was a thing
691.05  I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it
691.06  not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his
691.07  appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it
691.08  was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel
691.09  story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did
691.10  I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see
691.11  that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young
691.12  girl at Pooles Myriorana and turned my back on him when he slinked out
691.13  looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up
691.14  to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all
691.15  the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a
691.16  long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got
691.17  in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I
691.18  do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter
691.19  when I came into the front room for the matches to show him Dignams
691.20  death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the
691.21  blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that
691.22  was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit
691.23  like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle
691.24  any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual
691.25  kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws who he does it with
691.26  or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the
691.27  two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had
691.28  in Ontario Terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough
691.29  to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a
691.30  suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his
691.31  coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking
691.32  water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining
691.33  servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas if you please
691.34  O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per
691.35  doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was
691.36  sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like
691.37  that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond
692.01  of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be
692.02  alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in
692.03  her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much
692.04  I saw to that her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her
692.05  weeks notice better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself
692.06  quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to
692.07  him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if
692.08  I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one deuying
692.09  it up to my face and singing about the place in the WC too because she
692.10  knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that
692.11  long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom
692.12  when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by
692.13  the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like
692.14  that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May Moon shes
692.15  beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he
692.16  said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him
692.17  the satisfaction in any case God knows hes change in a way not to be always
692.18  and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do
692.19  it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little
692.20  alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him
692.21  turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down
692.22  on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question
692.23  and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with
692.24  a bishop yes I would because I told him about some Dean or Bishop was
692.25  sitting beside me in the jews Temples gardens when I was knitting that
692.26  woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the
692.27  monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him
692.28  worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of
692.29  who is it tell me his name who tell me who the German Emperor is it yes
692.30  imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of
692.31  me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life
692.32  simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it
692.33  till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale
692.34  anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it
692.35  people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and
692.36  think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying
692.37  him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all
693.01  over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me
693.02  sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss
693.03  long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that
693.04  confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and
693.05  what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but
693.06  whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes
693.07  rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom
693.08  right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did
693.09  you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the
693.10  real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God
693.11  he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither
693.12  would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know
693.13  me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never
693.14  turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a
693.15  woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like
693.16  to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like
693.17  the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too
693.18  careful about himself then give something to HH the pope for a penance
693.19  I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind
693.20  going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass
693.21  am I I suppose he was thinking of his father I wonder is he awake thinking of
693.22  me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he
693.23  smelt of some kind of a drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind
693.24  of paste they stick their bills up with some liquor Id like to sip those richlooking
693.25  green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the
693.26  opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had
693.27  the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself
693.28  from falling asleep after the last time we took the port and potted meat
693.29  it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell
693.30  asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that
693.31  thunder woke me up as if the world was coming to an end God be
693.32  merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish
693.33  when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
693.34  Gibraltar and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if
693.35  it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the
693.36  candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it
693.37  brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church
694.01  burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the
694.02  blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron
694.03  or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten
694.04  oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all
694.05  my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he
694.06  must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with
694.07  a big hole in the middle of us like a Stallion driving it up into you because
694.08  thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye
694.09  I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk
694.10  in him when I made him pull it out and do it on me considering how big it
694.11  is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last
694.12  time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him
694.13  to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd
694.14  know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her
694.15  teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers
694.16  filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always
694.17  with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like
694.18  a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time
694.19  I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt
694.20  hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen
694.21  out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another
694.22  not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong
694.23  child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully
694.24  jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about
694.25  me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do
694.26  him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he
694.27  was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons
694.28  housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck on account of not
694.29  liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics
694.30  he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he
694.31  made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about every thing I was fuming
694.32  with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first
694.33  socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still
694.34  he knows a lot of mixed up things especially about the body and the insides
694.35  I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family
694.36  physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded
694.37  and watch him after that I pretended I had on a coolness with her over him
695.01  mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter
695.02  because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp yes because
695.03  he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing
695.04  he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to
695.05  because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you
695.06  going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of lord Byrons
695.07  poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily
695.08  get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with
695.09  her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the
695.10  onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or
695.11  touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then wouldsend them all
695.12  spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would
695.13  only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much
695.14  mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the
695.15  eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration
695.16  with his plabbery kind of a manner to her like he did to me though I had the devils
695.17  own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could
695.18  hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me
695.19  too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something
695.20  I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with
695.21  my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the
695.22  night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than
695.23  was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he
695.24  was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I
695.25  washed up and down as far as possible asking me did you wash possible the
695.26  women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there
695.27  they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when
695.28  they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont
695.29  wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look
695.30  like lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was
695.31  a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the
695.32  day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins
695.33  falling one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
695.34  humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant
695.35  because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just
695.36  enough to make her month water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken
695.37  the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now
696.01  after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look
696.02  drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a
696.03  row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a
696.04  conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it
696.05  she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots
696.06  on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a
696.07  thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not
696.08  the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyway whatever he does always wipes
696.09  his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own
696.10  boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like
696.11  that and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a
696.12  postcard up up O Sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you
696.13  stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
696.14  could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry
696.15  another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up
696.16  with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too
696.17  at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband
696.18  for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her
696.19  wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course
696.20  some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the
696.21  worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so
696.22  bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic
696.23  she put in his tea of flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked
696.24  him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must
696.25  have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being
696.26  hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides
696.27  theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they</p>
696.28  <p>theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
696.29  noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the DBC with
696.30  Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered
696.31  2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of
696.32  sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it
696.33  dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you
696.34  half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew
696.35  fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on
696.36  the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted
696.37  me to put it in the Irish Times lost in the ladies lavatory DBC Dame street
697.01  finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out
697.02  through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there
697.03  for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him
697.04  because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the
697.05  shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a
697.06  ring with the stone for my mouth a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one
697.07  and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend
697.08  once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold
697.09  and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the
697.10  fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the
697.11  hearthrug in Lombard street well and another time it was my muddy boots
697.12  hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes
697.13  not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give
697.14  9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him
697.15  I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with
697.16  the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before
697.17  somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time
697.18  Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing
697.19  me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods <i>Ave Maria</i> what are we waiting
697.20  for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown
697.21  part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always
697.22  raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing
697.23  then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see
697.24  anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and
697.25  surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we
697.26  did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen
697.27  without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were
697.28  engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10
697.29  times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my
697.30  drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth Square he kissed
697.31  me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions
697.32  is it permitted to inquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep
697.33  it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his
697.34  pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen
697.35  always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts
697.36  blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him
697.37  at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the
698.01  sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind
698.02  following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the
698.03  corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler
698.04  in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking
698.05  slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go
698.06  and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were
698.07  not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where
698.08  are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on
698.09  my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting
698.10  too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to
698.11  say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork
698.12  sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand
698.13  anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give
698.14  him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket <i>O Maria
698.15  Santisima</i> he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he
698.16  had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange
698.17  petticoat I had on with sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel
698.18  down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new
698.19  raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage
698.20  for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers
698.21  outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from
698.22  doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he
698.23  circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything
698.24  too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time
698.25  for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had
698.26  to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all
698.27  those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his
698.28  company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me
698.29  have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had
698.30  a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking
698.31  or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew
698.32  what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you
698.33  I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a
698.34  picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find
698.35  anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing a letter every
698.36  morning sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the
698.37  way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine
699.01  was the 8^#'t^#'h then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I
699.02  couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he
699.03  never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday
699.04  as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer
699.05  the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed
699.06  or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface
699.07  Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all
699.08  flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to
699.09  say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible
699.10  to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through
699.11  the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him
699.12  sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with
699.13  nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at
699.14  the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the
699.15  2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch
699.16  he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I
699.17  threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was
699.18  whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift
699.19  or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as
699.20  well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant
699.21  if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any
699.22  fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me
699.23  with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a
699.24  cough knocking on the wall then he wouldnt believe next day we didnt do
699.25  something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling
699.26  him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes
699.27  going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going
699.28  to the Mallow Concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of
699.29  us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing
699.30  about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him
699.31  making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start
699.32  but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class
699.33  carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes
699.34  when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage
699.35  door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was
699.36  done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely
699.37  soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it
700.01  in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose there'll be the usual idiots
700.02  of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that
700.03  was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the
700.04  carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him
700.05  1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the
700.06  nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say
700.07  eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at
700.08  where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little
700.09  chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on
700.10  account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded
700.11  beggar and wearing a brooch for lord Roberts when I had the map of it
700.12  all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt
700.13  put it past him like he got me on to sing in the <i>Stabat Mater</i> by going
700.14  around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up
700.15  to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead
700.16  Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some
700.17  of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual
700.18  trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is
700.19  very intelligent the coming man Griffith is he well he doesnt look it thats all
700.20  I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the
700.21  mention of politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein
700.22  where Gardner Lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever
700.23  he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he
700.24  was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal
700.25  lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be
700.26  seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they
700.27  could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of
700.28  the old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for
700.29  years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even
700.30  decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in
700.31  review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after
700.32  looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies
700.33  or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time
700.34  at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the
700.35  lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his
700.36  father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he
700.37  could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve
701.01  lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy
701.02  a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be
701.03  exciting going around with him shopping buying those things in a new
701.04  city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get
701.05  it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers
701.06  or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go
701.07  and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes
701.08  not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out
701.09  whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the
701.10  handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching
701.11  down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his
701.12  hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put
701.13  it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her
701.14  like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so
701.15  quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it
701.16  takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with
701.17  the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his
701.18  clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few
701.19  minutes after he came back with the stop press tearing up the tickets and
701.20  swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider
701.21  that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him
701.22  to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree
701.23  dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord
701.24  Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed
701.25  him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have
701.26  picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it it was so tasty and
701.27  browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything
701.28  on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish
701.29  I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was
701.30  playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a
701.31  restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful
701.32  for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the
701.33  way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least
701.34  two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of
701.35  drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in
701.36  Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian
701.37  singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the
702.01  second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have
702.02  brought them back to Lewers this morning and kick up a row and
702.03  made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk
702.04  of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting
702.05  corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the
702.06  hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a
702.07  delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the
702.08  lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the
702.09  stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes
702.10  was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the
702.11  old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he
702.12  tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare
702.13  his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises
702.14  I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it thin ones are not so much
702.15  the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats
702.16  all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the
702.17  face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told
702.18  him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it
702.19  God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle
702.20  anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or
702.21  chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was
702.22  beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer
702.23  where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all
702.24  like that and the four paltry handerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant
702.25  get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it
702.26  Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful
702.27  of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues
702.28  itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they Ive no
702.29  clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the
702.30  cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching
702.31  up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you
702.32  because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer
702.33  every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all
702.34  Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much
702.35  older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane
702.36  she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing
702.37  it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning
703.01  to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only
703.02  got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the Jersey
703.03  Lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man
703.04  going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way
703.05  only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there
703.06  was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an
703.07  oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing around
703.08  her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing
703.09  like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master
703.10  Francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her
703.11  ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her
703.12  a -- e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of
703.13  all things with the old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and
703.14  that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came
703.15  to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord
703.16  flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about
703.17  he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant
703.18  Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could
703.19  have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her
703.20  side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a
703.21  rich lady of course she felt honoured H.R.H. he was in Gibraltar the year
703.22  I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted
703.23  more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come
703.24  a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman
703.25  with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or
703.26  something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put
703.27  him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers
703.28  plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your
703.29  programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell
703.30  of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he
703.31  could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to
703.32  try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager
703.33  he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the
703.34  mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old
703.35  rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but
703.36  theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it
703.37  was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and
704.01  Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a
704.02  lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me
704.03  altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and
704.04  cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by
704.05  his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats
704.06  alright the one like a wedding cake standing up miles off my head he said suited
704.07  me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles
704.08  about the shop girl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to
704.09  bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying
704.10  Im afraid were giving you too much trouble whats she there for but I stared
704.11  it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the
704.12  second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see
704.13  him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for
704.14  me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry
704.15  Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him
704.16  being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know
704.17  my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and
704.18  Im sure you were</p>
704.19  <p>yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made
704.20  me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the
704.21  nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those
704.22  eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins
704.23  and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre
704.24  supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum
704.25  one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of
704.26  course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and
704.27  his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack
704.28  no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf the woman is beauty of course
704.29  thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich
704.30  fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the
704.31  clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the
704.32  nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that
704.33  dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has the nymphs used they go about like
704.34  that I asked him that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market
704.35  or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of
704.36  the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing
704.37  out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own
705.01  they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying
705.02  to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse
705.03  near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch
705.04  my eye or if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those
705.05  rotten places the night coming home with of those rotten places the night
705.06  coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to
705.07  make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I
705.08  couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months
705.09  after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the
705.10  mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a
705.11  sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick
705.12  or a bang of something there and that word met something with hoses in
705.13  it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never
705.14  can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and
705.15  burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much
705.16  theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to
705.17  scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk
705.18  with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have
705.19  got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate
705.20  looking student that stopped in n° 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly
705.21  caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
705.22  my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got
705.23  doctor Brady to give me the Belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck
705.24  them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he
705.25  wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody
705.26  ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of
705.27  the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so
705.28  much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock
705.29  like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth
705.30  all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord
705.31  I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with
705.32  and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he
705.33  made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming
705.34  for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord
705.35  I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not
705.36  to look ugly or those lines ftom the strain who knows the way hed take it you
705.37  want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of
706.01  them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt
706.02  talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and
706.03  my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one
706.04  Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday</p>
706.05  <p>frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines
706.06  have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them
706.07  all sides like the end of Loves old sweet sonnnng the poor men that have to be
706.08  out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling
706.09  it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo bits
706.10  leaving things like that lying around hes getting very careless and threw the
706.11  rest of them up in the WC Ill get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead
706.12  of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him

706.16  there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock

706.19  they all whitehot and the mosquito nets and the smell of the rainwater in

706.33  wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot
706.34  for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez
706.35  was given the bulls ear clothes we have to wear whoever invented them
706.36  expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed
706.37  up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way
707.01  thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the
707.02  banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes
707.03  of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white
707.04  mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard
707.05  of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off
707.06  the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I
707.07  suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you
707.08  feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a
707.09  girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me
707.10  how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to
707.11  make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what
707.12  age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms
707.13  round me then we were fighting in the morning with lhe pillow what
707.14  fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on
707.15  the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I
707.16  looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our
707.17  eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were
707.18  dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly
707.19  recognized myself the change I had a splendid skin from the sun and the
707.20  excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice
707.21  on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the
707.22  Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read
707.23  and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other
707.24  woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt
707.25  without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs
707.26  Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like
707.27  that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shopifting
707.28  anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it this blanket is too heavy on
707.29  me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled
707.30  up under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering
707.31  then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my
707.32  bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got
707.33  up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them
707.34  at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it
707.35  seems centuries of course they never come back and she didnt put her
707.36  address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always
707.37  going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats
708.01  with their high heads rocking and the swell of the ship those Officers uniforms
708.02  on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious
708.03  I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me
708.04  six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were
708.05  taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special
708.06  kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side
708.07  like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I
708.08  was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy
708.09  where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him
708.10  toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and
708.11  booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing
708.12  everything down in all directions of you didnt open the windows when
708.13  general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great
708.14  fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the codsul that was there from
708.15  before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the
708.16  same old reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate
708.17  poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than
708.18  the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound
708.19  clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with
708.20  his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only Captain Groves and father
708.21  talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at
708.22  Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old
708.23  devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his
708.24  nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he
708.25  never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some
708.26  blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course
708.27  but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I supposed he died
708.28  of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living
708.29  soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so
708.30  bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with
708.31  the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah
708.32  all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the
708.33  hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow

709.07  his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken

710.03  <p>Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio
710.04  brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand
710.05  me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it
710.06  with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her
710.07  switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near
710.08  80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering
710.09  because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships
710.10  of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because
710.11  4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run
710.12  into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her
710.13  except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and
710.14  her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on
710.15  Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing
710.16  the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed
710.17  it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him
710.18  following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just
710.19  in passing I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside
710.20  my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father
710.21  was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of
710.22  stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on
710.23  the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under
710.24  the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what
710.25  kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike
710.26  young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I
710.27  tell him I was engaged for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don
710.28  Miguel de la Flora and he believed that I was to be married to him in 3
710.29  years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh
710.30  a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the
710.31  Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him
710.32  excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt
710.33  count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from
710.34  he said on the Blackwater but it was too short then the day before he left may
710.35  yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in
710.36  the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun
710.37  near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old
711.01  Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on
711.02  each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the
711.03  chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was
711.04  looking at me I had that white blouse on open at the front to encourage him
711.05  as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump
711.06  I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it
711.07  must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those
711.08  frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call
711.09  them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats
711.10  the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships
711.11  out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky
711.12  you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside
711.13  they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my
711.14  white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best
711.15  my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his
711.16  chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt
711.17  let him he was awfully put out first for fear your never know consumption
711.18  or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one
711.19  drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it
711.20  might break and get lost up in me somewhere yes because they once took something
711.21  down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre
711.22  all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never
711.23  get far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time
711.24  yes because theres a wonderful feeling there all the time so tender how did we
711.25  finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not
711.26  to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my
711.27  petticoat I had a skirt opening up the side I tortured the life out of him first
711.28  tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssst awokwokawok his
711.29  eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like
711.30  that morning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when
711.31  I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of
711.32  eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them
711.33  Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it
711.34  yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so
711.35  I went around to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache
711.36  had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was
711.37  married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block
712.01  me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a Captain or admiral its nearly
712.02  20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his
712.03  hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognize him hes young still
712.04  about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed
712.05  they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what
712.06  I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad
712.07  daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put
712.08  an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the
712.09  old bag the biscuits were finrom Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang
712.10  all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we
712.11  went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace
712.12  pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said
712.13  he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peaked cap on
712.14  that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight HMS Calypso
712.15  swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach
712.16  about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing
712.17  peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more
712.18  money I suppose theyre called after him I never tho ught that would be my
712.19  name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a
712.20  visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking
712.21  blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or
712.22  Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom
712.23  or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either

712.25  have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had
712.26  Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Willis road to Europe

712.30  the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing
712.31  them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men
712.32  have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a

713.05  perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and
713.06  left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento

713.08  South Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but

714.32  end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and
714.33  I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on
714.34  the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake
714.35  I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but
714.36  I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that
714.37  when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always

715.17  telling the boatmen he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the
715.18  steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old
715.19  thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me to pull the
715.20  right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through
715.21  through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent
715.22  all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep
715.23  yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off
715.24  him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he
715.25  was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed
715.26  chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City
715.27  Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he
715.28  wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was
715.29  no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that
715.30  book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other
715.31  Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with
715.32  his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white
715.33  shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather
715.34  all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell
715.35  of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay
715.36  round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old
715.37  Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with
716.01  the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose
716.02  theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big
716.03  barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought
716.04  a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was
716.05  going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private
716.06  hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did
716.07  down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but
716.08  I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon
716.09  Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut
716.10  out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I
716.11  liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will
716.12  you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the
716.13  plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar
716.14  at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot
716.15  in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal
716.16  he was called in Lloyd's Weekly News 20 years in jail then he comes out and
716.17  murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or
716.18  whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till
716.19  I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked
716.20  up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine
716.21  tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her
716.22  bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing
716.23  the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his
716.24  shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a
716.25  sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the
716.26  burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the
716.27  feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl
716.28  down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead
716.29  of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting
716.30  all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and
716.31  Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out
716.32  I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first
716.33  gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against
716.34  the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your
716.35  nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to
716.36  look at her it he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue
716.37  with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian
717.01  boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even
717.02  teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed
717.03  he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper
717.04  and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the
717.05  house and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her
717.06  its meshed tell not him he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a
717.07  matter of fact I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im
717.08  not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too
717.09  with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray
717.10  girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what
717.11  they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night
717.12  its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting
717.13  to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt
717.14  it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the
717.15  bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt
717.16  to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding
717.17  too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is
717.18  a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the
717.19  pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs
717.20  up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all
717.21  look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on
717.22  you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the
717.23  Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid
717.24  of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go in
717.25  theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that
717.26  fellow in the pit at the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last
717.27  time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum
717.28  every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think
717.29  I saw him after trying to get near two stylish dressed ladies outside Switzers
717.30  window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and
717.31  everything but he didnt remember me and she didnt even want me to kiss her
717.32  at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance
717.33  on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen
717.34  wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never
717.35  came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always
717.36  only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing
717.37  to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped
718.01  when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin
718.02  Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must
718.03  be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose
718.04  there are few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really
718.05  happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their
718.06  natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that
718.07  would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his
718.08  father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old
718.09  man I suppose he felt lost always making love to my things too the few old rags
718.10  I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on
718.11  her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing
718.12  shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but
718.13  theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman
718.14  when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher
718.15  at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery
718.16  the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks
718.17  across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that
718.18  for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting
718.19  I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or
718.20  I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and
718.21  over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody
718.22  to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith
718.23  I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that
718.24  myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having
718.25  the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I
718.26  ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming
718.27  Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old
718.28  Mrs Flemming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her
718.29  hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help
718.30  it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the
718.31  dresser I knew there was something and opened the window to let out the
718.32  smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked
718.33  home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon
718.34  Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat
718.35  on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing
718.36  laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever
718.37  he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if
719.01  anybody saw him that knew us wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand
719.02  funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking
719.03  him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity
719.04  it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up
719.05  too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark
719.06  the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else
719.07  and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as
719.08  she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something
719.09  wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its

719.17  wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply
719.18  sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only tim ewe were in
719.19  a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the
719.20  Gaiety something he did about insurance for him Drimmies I was fit to be
719.21  tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at
719.22  me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and
719.23  his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could
719.24  all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then
719.25  to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a
719.26  fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress
719.27  he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running
719.28  round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had
719.29  then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood
719.30  up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow

719.37  that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this
720.01  damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us
720.02  away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the
720.03  floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think
720.04  it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look
720.05  like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up
720.06  my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber
720.07  gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode
720.08  I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the
720.09  easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the
720.10  other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my
720.11  breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time
720.12  I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy
720.13  I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have
720.14  to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of
720.15  thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right
720.16  there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind
720.17  being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre
720.18  making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore</p>
720.19  <p>who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something
720.20  growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit
720.21  Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like
720.22  before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey
720.23  made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke
720.24  road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors
720.25  and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to
720.26  him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money
720.27  of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man
720.28  in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling
720.29  around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour
720.30  what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if
720.31  I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriment
720.32  I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was
720.33  talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention
720.34  too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can
720.35  squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres
720.36  something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child
720.37  whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much
721.01  is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do
721.02  those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted
721.03  eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or
721.04  God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out
721.05  frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying
721.06  strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to
721.07  spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my
721.08  Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything
721.09  underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something
721.10  he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 or
721.11  5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am
721.12  quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only
721.13  natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever
721.14  we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another
721.15  for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my
721.16  being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said
721.17  with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going
721.18  to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all
721.19  his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool
721.20  of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau
721.21  pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling
721.22  about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then
721.23  might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton
721.24  square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash
721.25  it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still
721.26  round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight
721.27  sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman
721.28  could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all
721.29  creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at
721.30  the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick
721.31  or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like
721.32  that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare
721.33  street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes
721.34  sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords
721.35  both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody
721.36  I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet
721.37  up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins
722.01  are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes
722.02  sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great
722.03  value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance
722.04  of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying
722.05  ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed
722.06  always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often
722.07  enough and he thinks father bought it form Lord Napier that I used to
722.08  admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my
722.09  bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were
722.10  we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and
722.11  Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run
722.12  again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with
722.13  our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse
722.14  says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody
722.15  inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in
722.16  there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts
722.17  his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes
722.18  going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our
722.19  salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with
722.20  the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner
722.21  Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling
722.22  along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much
722.23  consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging
722.24  by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells
722.25  wait 3 quarters the hour wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for
722.26  him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody
722.27  saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt
722.28  to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose
722.29  he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for
722.30  their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont
722.31  believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats
722.32  Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real
722.33  life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more
722.34  with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind
722.35  of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their
722.36  empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and
722.37  toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any
723.01  more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man
723.02  tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the
723.03  way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat
723.04  any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out
723.05  enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his
723.06  own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen
723.07  I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to
723.08  sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head
723.09  with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with
723.10  a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis
723.11  as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband
723.12  yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at
723.13  the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob
723.14  let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing
723.15  skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and
723.16  thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they
723.17  were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in
723.18  if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled
723.19  drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan
723.20  that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the
723.21  mens WC drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and
723.22  the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage
723.23  skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want
723.24  to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck
723.25  as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day
723.26  I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying
723.27  one another and they all with their wives and families at home more
723.28  especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is
723.29  always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking
723.30  man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of
723.31  them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if
723.32  I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he
723.33  goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every
723.34  penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family
723.35  goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him
723.36  what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little
723.37  teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill
724.01  Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her
724.02  appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodloking what men
724.03  wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone
724.04  the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed
724.05  and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a
724.06  wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must
724.07  have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved
724.08  seats for that to see him and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half
724.09  screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his
724.10  so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for
724.11  flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera
724.12  he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye <i>sweet</i>heart he always
724.13  sang it not like Bartell D'Arcy sweet <i>tart</i> goodbye of course he had the gift
724.14  of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O
724.15  Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for
724.16  my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding
724.17  but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower
724.18  now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a
724.19  university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at
724.20  now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken
724.21  in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he
724.22  didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw
724.23  him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was
724.24  in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good
724.25  in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other of course
724.26  he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by
724.27  this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord
724.28  Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at
724.29  Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold
724.30  on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a
724.31  young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him
724.32  but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the
724.33  other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a Journey by
724.34  laud then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the
724.35  8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for
724.36  new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was
724.37  something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging
725.01  into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about
725.02  like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always
725.03  liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like Byron
725.04  and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different
725.05  I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
725.06  yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes
725.07  20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuck up
725.08  university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old
725.09  kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to
725.10  understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes
725.11  very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he
725.12  was a patent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in
725.13  their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs
725.14  of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon
725.15  shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse
725.16  at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go
725.17  back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for
725.18  him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves
725.19  own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the
725.20  Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always
725.21  listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad
725.22  then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes
725.23  very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck
725.24  besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand
725.25  bathing place from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a
725.26  God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men
725.27  like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue
725.28  he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his
725.29  finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt
725.30  I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple
725.31  I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was
725.32  asking you to suck it so clean and white he looked with his boyish face I would
725.33  too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the
725.34  dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men
725.35  I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of
725.36  them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if
725.37  I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the
726.01  1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard come out or Ill try pairing
726.02  the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or
726.03  learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if
726.04  he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make
726.05  him feel all over him till he half faints nnder me then hell write about me lover
726.06  and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he
726.07  becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though</p>
726.08  <p>no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor
726.09  no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom
726.10  because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from
726.11  a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place
726.12  pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced
726.13  without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half
726.14  of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old
726.15  hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his
726.16  way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what
726.17  with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself
726.18  an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and
726.19  tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes
726.20  its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body
726.21  were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for
726.22  a change just to try with that thing they have swelling upon you so hard and
726.23  at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long
726.24  I heard those cornerboys saying passing the corner of Marrowbone lane my
726.25  aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was
726.26  passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he
726.27  puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you
726.28  put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and
726.29  choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their
726.30  different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be
726.31  always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start
726.32  I tell you for stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over
726.33  it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together
726.34  well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever
726.35  he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair
726.36  Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or
726.37  wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given
727.01  all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its
727.02  a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold
727.03  never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me
727.04  not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id
727.05  throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1
727.06  atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before
727.07  ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough
727.08  I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our
727.09  halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but
727.10  me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make
727.11  her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody
727.12  if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking
727.13  would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know
727.14  me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose
727.15  I was only to do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking
727.16  gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to
727.17  try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for
727.18  the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd
727.19  stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch
727.20  attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word
727.21  or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their
727.22  silk hats that K.C. lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke
727.23  lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the
727.24  boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters
727.25  and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a
727.26  woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home
727.27  to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten
727.28  again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of
727.29  Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep
727.30  and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he
727.31  came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark
727.32  man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he
727.33  does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to
727.34  get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did
727.35  you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and
727.36  they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the
727.37  world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and
728.01  killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling
728.02  around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it
728.03  on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop
728.04  sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it
728.05  is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of
728.06  them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I
728.07  suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and
728.08  not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor
728.09  case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was
728.10  he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was
728.11  watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that
728.12  disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that
728.13  little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but
728.14  I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the
728.15  same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any
728.16  more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was
728.17  somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting
728.18  God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt
728.19  like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely
728.20  hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night
728.21  they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont
728.22  get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women
728.23  no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I
728.24  suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he
728.25  could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was
728.26  as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have
728.27  heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those
728.28  names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there
728.29  father Vial plana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y O'Reilly
728.30  in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor
728.31  street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name
728.32  like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and
728.33  Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame
728.34  to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a
728.35  day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish
728.36  como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I
728.37  thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place
729.01  or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent
729.02  me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always
729.03  knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the
729.04  Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure
729.05  the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have
729.06  brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on
729.07  the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the
729.08  watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen
729.09  he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the
729.10  criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see
729.11  something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not
729.12  knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we
729.13  were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos
729.14  huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head
729.15  sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the
729.16  room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his
729.17  writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and
729.18  if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the
729.19  breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in
729.20  lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love
729.21  to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get
729.22  a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or
729.23  yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a
729.24  peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or
729.25  18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im
729.26  sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all
729.27  the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid
729.28  fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet
729.29  theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are
729.30  and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt
729.31  in your mouth like when I used to be in the in the longing way then Ill throw
729.32  him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his
729.33  mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go
729.34  about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto
729.35  then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son più forte Ill put on my
729.36  best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky
729.37  stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked
730.01  yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times
730.02  handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother
730.03  to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my
730.04  belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell
730.05  him every scrap and make him do it in front of me serve him right its all his
730.06  own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about
730.07  it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not
730.08  much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is
730.09  supposed to be there for or He wouldn't have made us the way He did so
730.10  attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers
730.11  and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue
730.12  7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want
730.13  £ 1 or perhaps 30/ Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me
730.14  that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other
730.15  women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write
730.16  his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up
730.17  besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt
730.18  smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent

732.02  morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who
732.03  else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all
732.04  clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep
732.05  and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the
732.06  big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old
732.07  yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you
732.08  to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows
732.09  of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and
732.10  the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed
732.11  the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O
732.12  that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like
732.13  fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes
732.14  and all the queer little streets and pink and blue and yellow houses and
732.15  the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar
732.16  as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in
732.17  my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he
732.18  kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another
732.19  and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me
732.20  would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around
732.21  him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume
