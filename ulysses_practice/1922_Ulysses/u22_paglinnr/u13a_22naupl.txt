331.01  <p>The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
331.02  embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too
331.03  fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of
331.04  dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown
331.05  rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church
331.06  whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to
331.07  her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man,
331.08  Mary, star of the sea.</p>
331.09  <p>The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
331.10  scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were
331.11  they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the
331.12  sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman
331.13  with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little
331.14  curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name
331.15  H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins,
331.16  scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all
331.17  that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about
331.18  them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building
331.19  castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball,  happy as the day
331.20  was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the
331.21  pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but
331.22  eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just
331.23  beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over him to tease
331.24  his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p>
331.25  <p>--Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of
331.26  water.</p>
332.01  <p>And baby prattled after her:</p>
332.02  <p>--A jink a jink a jawbo.</p>
332.03  <p>Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,
332.04  so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take
332.05  his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him
332.06  the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a
332.07  persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby  was as good as gold, a
332.08  perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora Mac
332.09  Flimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of
332.10  life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
332.11  cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed
332.12  too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
332.13  <p>But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
332.14  Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this
332.15  golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky
332.16  had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be
332.17  architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if
332.18  Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the
332.19  maxim that every little Irishman's house is his castle, he fell upon his hated
332.20  rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to
332.21  relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master
332.22  Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
332.23  <p>--Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively, at once! And you,
332.24  Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you
332.25  for that.</p>
332.26  <p>His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their
332.27  big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was  after his
332.28  misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables were full of sand
332.29  but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and
332.30  and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.
332.31  Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she
332.32  kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and
332.33  said if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in
332.34  admonition.</p>
332.35  <p>--Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.</p>
332.36  <p>She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
332.37  <p>--What's your name? Butter and cream?</p>
333.01  <p>--Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your
333.02  sweetheart?</p>
333.03  <p>--Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
333.04  <p>--Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
333.05  <p>--Nao, Tommy said.</p>
333.06  <p>--I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
333.07  her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart, Gerty is Tommy's
333.08  sweetheart.</p>
333.09  <p>--Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</p>
333.10  <p>Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
333.11  Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentlemen
333.12  couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.</p>
333.13  <p>But who was Gerty?</p>
333.14  <p>Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
333.15  gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome
333.16  Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all
333.17  who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a
333.18  MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility
333.19  but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world
333.20  of good much better than the Widow Welch's female pills and she was
333.21  much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The
333.22  waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though
333.23  her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands
333.24  were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemon
333.25  juice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she
333.26  used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told
333.27  that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers
333.28  drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to
333.29  time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not  let on whatever she did that
333.30  it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where
333.31  honour is due. There wasan innate refinement, a languid queenly <i>hauteur</i>
333.32  about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and
333.33  higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of
333.34  high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good
333.35  education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady
333.36  in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow
333.37  and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to
334.01  her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
334.02  softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted
334.03  a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why
334.04  have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set
334.05  off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows
334.06  were not so silkilyseductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the
334.07  Woman Beautiful page of the Princess novelette, who had first advised her to
334.08  try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming
334.09  in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing
334.10  scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a
334.11  beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a
334.12  button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was
334.13  dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account
334.14  of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
334.15  luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now
334.16  at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into
334.17  her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety
334.18  God's fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.</p>
334.19  <p>For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was
334.20  about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination
334.21  prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips
334.22  pouted a while but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little
334.23  laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew
334.24  right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him
334.25  cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lover's quarrel. As per usual
334.26  somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle always
334.27  riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in
334.28  the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on
334.29  and he was going to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high
334.30  school like his brother W.E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in
334.31  Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull
334.32  aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and
334.33  perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his
334.34  family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the blessed
334.35  Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an
334.36  exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape
334.37  of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere
335.01  something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp
335.02  with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes
335.03  and besides they were both of a size  and that was why Edy Boardman thought
335.04  she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in
335.05  front of her bit of a garden.</p>
335.06  <p>Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
335.07  Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A
335.08  neat blouse of electric blue, selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected
335.09  in the <i>Lady's Pictorial</i> that electric blue would be worn), with a smart vee
335.10  opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a
335.11  piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief
335.12  spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the strideshowed off her slim
335.13  graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of
335.14  wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille
335.15  and at the side a butterfly bow  to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was
335.16  hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery's
335.17  summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven
335.18  fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers
335.19  when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror
335.20  gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she
335.21  knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes
335.22  were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was
335.23  very <i>petite</i> but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never
335.24  would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle at her
335.25  higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions
335.26  beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely
335.27  limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As
335.28  for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering
335.29  hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen
335.30  again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets, with
335.31  awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted
335.32  with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen and
335.33  she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash
335.34  and ironed them and she had a brickbat  to keep the iron on because she
335.35  wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the
335.36  things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own
335.37  colour and the lucky colour too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on
336.01  her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his
336.02  father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she
336.03  thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning
336.04  she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and
336.05  lovers' meetings if you put those things on inside out  so long as it wasn't of
336.06  a Friday.</p>
336.07  <p>And yet  and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
336.08  there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to
336.09  be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she
336.10  could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings. Though not too much
336.11  because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it
336.12  said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty
336.13  MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the first that her daydream
336.14  of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy
336.15  Wylie T.C.D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs
336.16  Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a
336.17  sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.
336.18  He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman's
336.19  birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoers' (he was still in short
336.20  trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she
336.21  went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely husky
336.22  voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her
336.23  nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.
336.24  Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong
336.25  point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man
336.26  among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year
336.27  too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare
336.28  and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face
336.29  who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and
336.30  who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in
336.31  all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long
336.32  kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer
336.33  eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be  his only, his affianced bride for
336.34  riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this
336.35  day forward.</p>
336.36  <p>And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar
336.37  she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself
337.01  his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the
337.02  face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, the spitfire, because she would be twentytwo
337.03  in November. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty
337.04  was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.
337.05  Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann's pudding of
337.06  delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky
337.07  hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in
337.08  the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of
337.09  eggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that
337.10  made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical
337.11  like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom
337.12  with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely
337.13  dog Garryowen that almost talked, it was so human, and chintz covers for the
337.14  chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they have in
337.15  rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired
337.16  tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed
337.17  sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon
337.18  (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug
337.19  and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky,
337.20  simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out
337.21  to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for
337.22  a moment deep down into her eyes.</p>
337.23  <p>Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes, so
337.24  then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off
337.25  and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said he
337.26  wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if
337.27  he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and
337.28  he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper
337.29  of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was
337.30  out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told
337.31  Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.</p>
337.32  <p>--You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.</p>
337.33  <p>But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
337.34  finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
337.35  Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.</p>
337.36  <p>--Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.</p>
337.37  <p>And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's
338.01  the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread carriage and here
338.02  he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy got as
338.03  cross as two sticks about hin getting him own way like that from everyone
338.04  always petting him.</p>
338.05  <p>--I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't
338.06  say.</p>
338.07  <p>--On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.</p>
338.08  <p>Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
338.09  saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life to
338.10  say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the
338.11  gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.</p>
338.12  <p>--Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her
338.13  nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at him.</p>
338.14  <p>Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.
338.15  For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and
338.16  jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her
338.17  nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where
338.18  you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.
338.19  That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget  the evening she
338.20  dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and
338.21  walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come
338.22  up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest
338.23  hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be
338.24  wholesome.</p>
338.25  <p>And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
338.26  anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted by the
338.27  missioner, the reverend  John Hughes S.J. rosary, sermon and benediction of
338.28  the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without
338.29  distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that
338.30  simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling
338.31  before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto,
338.32  beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy
338.33  virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided
338.34  the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders
338.35  the drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her
338.36  carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused
338.37  by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated
339.01  two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the
339.02  rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has
339.03  ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood
339.04  days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused
339.05  by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of
339.06  intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things
339.07  that Gerty knew it was  the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the
339.08  way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
339.09  <p>And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
339.10  Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, wrapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
339.11  companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off
339.12  Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself
339.13  passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him anyway
339.14  screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he
339.15  was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of
339.16  doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy
339.17  moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father! With all his faults she
339.18  loved him still when he sang <i>Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee</i> or <i>My love and
339.19  cottage near Rochelle</i> and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad
339.20  dressing for supper and when he sang <i>The moon hath raised</i> with Mr Dignam
339.21  that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.
339.22  Her mother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays
339.23  and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they
339.24  were to have had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so
339.25  hear. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a
339.26  warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral
339.27  on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters
339.28  and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic standard designs,
339.29  fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the
339.30  home.</p>
339.31  <p>A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
339.32  house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And
339.33  when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed on
339.34  the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't like her mother
339.35  taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words
339.36  about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.
339.37  It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty
340.01  who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight
340.02  the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac the picture of
340.03  halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then
340.04  with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
340.05  oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a story
340.06  behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft clinging
340.07  white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a
340.08  thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there
340.09  for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just
340.10  like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had
340.11  found out in Walker's pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa
340.12  Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
340.13  <p>The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion, till
340.14  at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting
340.15  behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards
340.16  the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his
340.17  dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself
340.18  came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed
340.19  their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the
340.20  gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or
340.21  twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down
340.22  the slope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock.
340.23  The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let
340.24  them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball
340.25  hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy
340.26  and Cissy laughed.</p>
340.27  <p>--If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
340.28  <p>Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her pretty
340.29  cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little
340.30  but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it
340.31  went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure
340.32  jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the
340.33  gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always
340.34  with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they
340.35  had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her
340.36  new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the
340.37  twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.</p>
341.01  <p>Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
341.02  and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
341.03  original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel
341.04  of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were
341.05  there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered,
341.06  their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend
341.07  father  Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous
341.08  prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not
341.09  recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever
341.10  abandoned by her.</p>
341.11  <p>The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
341.12  childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy  played with baby
341.13  Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried
341.14  behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then
341.15  Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn't the little chap
341.16  enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.</p>
341.17  <p>--Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
341.18  <p>And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven
341.19  months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect
341.20  little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great,
341.21  they said.</p>
341.22  <p>--Haja ja ja haja.</p>
341.23  <p>Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit
341.24  up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy
341.25  saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other
341.26  way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such
341.27  toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:</p>
341.28  <p>--Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.</p>
341.29  <p>And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no
341.30  use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee
341.31  and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always, readywitted, gave him in his mouth
341.32  the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
341.33  <p>Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
341.34  of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of
341.35  twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man
341.36  used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too
341.37  leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming
342.01  out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the
342.02  perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. And
342.03  while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at and
342.04  there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would
342.05  search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they
342.06  were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer.
342.07  She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he
342.08  was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinée
342.09  idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck
342.10  like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on
342.11  account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a
342.12  slightly <i>retroussé</i> from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could
342.13  see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would
342.14  have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still
342.15  and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles
342.16  of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She
342.17  was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking
342.18  Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she
342.19  had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face
342.20  because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one
342.21  else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband.
342.22  because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned
342.23  against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked
342.24  man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert
342.25  him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing with
342.26  heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls, unfeminine,
342.27  he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just
342.28  yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,
342.29  make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace
342.30  her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his
342.31  ownest girlie, for herself alone.</p>
342.32  <p>Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. <i>Ora pro nobis.</i> Well has it
342.33  been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be
342.34  lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because
342.35  of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could picture the
342.36  whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles,
342.37  the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father
343.01  Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out
343.02  with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so
343.03  quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she
343.04  became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the
343.05  convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told
343.06  him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he
343.07  could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we
343.08  were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin
343.09  because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and
343.10  that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me
343.11  according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she
343.12  thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral
343.13  design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
343.14  mantelpiece white and gold with a canary bird that came out of a little house
343.15  to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours'
343.16  adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps
343.17  an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.</p>
343.18  <p>The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
343.19  threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys
343.20  common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good
343.21  hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy
343.22  and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide
343.23  might come in on them and be drowned.</p>
343.24  <p>--Jacky! Tommy!</p>
343.25  <p>Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
343.26  last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she
343.27  ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good
343.28  enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she
343.29  was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because it wasn't
343.30  natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery
343.31  strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight
343.32  on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a
343.33  forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and
343.34  just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the
343.35  end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would
343.36  have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on
343.37  purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and
344.01  got a fine tumble. <i>Tableau!</i> That would have been a very charming exposé for
344.02  a gentleman like that to witness.</p>
344.03  <p>Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
344.04  they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the
344.05  thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed
344.06  Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give
344.07  them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because she thought he might
344.08  be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty
344.09  could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon
344.10  O'Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking
344.11  up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing  <i>Tantum ergo</i> and she
344.12  just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the
344.13  <i>Tantumer gosa cramen tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in
344.14  Sparrow's of Ceorge's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and
344.15  there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent,
344.16  and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek
344.17  of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.</p>
344.18  <p>Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
344.19  her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel
344.20  tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight
344.21  before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.
344.22  Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a
344.23  daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders, a radiant
344.24  little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to
344.25  travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She
344.26  could almost see the swift answering flush of admiration in his eyes that set her
344.27  tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath
344.28  the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught
344.29  the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her
344.30  woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the
344.31  thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of
344.32  her face became a glorious rose.</p>
344.33  <p>Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
344.34  half smiling, with her specs, like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.
344.35  Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one
344.36  could get on with her, poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And
344.37  she said to Gerty:</p>
345.01  <p>--A penny for your thoughts.</p>
345.02  <p>--What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.
345.03  I was only wondering was it late.</p>
345.04  <p>Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and
345.05  their baby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a
345.06  gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the
345.07  time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time
345.08  to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
345.09  <p>--Wait, said Cissy, I'll  ask my uncle Peter over there what's the time by
345.10  his conundrum.</p>
345.11  <p>So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take
345.12  his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
345.13  watchchain, looking  at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty
345.14  could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had
345.15  been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment
345.16  it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his
345.17  distinguishedlooking figure.</p>
345.18  <p>Cissy said to excuse her would he mind  telling her what was the right
345.19  time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking
345.20  up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was
345.21  stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His
345.22  voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there
345.23  was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came
345.24  back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of
345.25  order.</p>
345.26  <p>Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon O'Hanlon
345.27  got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told
345.28  Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers
345.29  and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman
345.30  winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in
345.31  and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all
345.32  the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and
345.33  then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind
345.34  of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and
345.35  that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the
345.36  last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His
345.37  dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour,
346.01  literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration
346.02  in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. It
346.03  is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.</p>
346.04  <p>Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
346.05  noticed that that little hint she gave had  the desired effect because it was a long
346.06  way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar
346.07  and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied their hair to make herself
346.08  attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up
346.09  at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read
346.10  out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and Edy and Cissy were talking about the
346.11  time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own
346.12  coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was
346.13  she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply.
346.14  A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.
346.15  It hurt. O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things
346.16  like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty's
346.17  lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to
346.18  her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist
346.19  might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted
346.20  deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had
346.21  meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of
346.22  tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she
346.23  sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p>
346.24  <p>--O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
346.25  flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.</p>
346.26  <p>Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
346.27  ringdove but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice
346.28  that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with
346.29  his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was
346.30  so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on
346.31  him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared
346.32  to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make
346.33  him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight
346.34  extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was
346.35  simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that
346.36  shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
346.37  something aloof, apart in another sphere, that she was not of them  and there
347.01  was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their
347.02  pipe and smoke it.</p>
347.03  <p>Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked
347.04  in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the
347.05  sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior and Cissy told him too
347.06  that Billy Winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked
347.07  just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like
347.08  that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your
347.09  leave, sent up his compliments  on to his brandnew dribbling bib.</p>
347.10  <p>--O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.</p>
347.11  <p>The slight <i>contretemps</i> claimed her attention but in two twos she set
347.12  that little matter to rights.</p>
347.13  <p>Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
347.14  asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but
347.15  she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with
347.16  consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the
347.17  bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O'Hanlon
347.18  was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round him round his
347.19  shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.</p>
347.20  <p>How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
347.21  Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat
347.22  flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny
347.23  lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque
347.24  she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than
347.25  to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the
347.26  presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the
347.27  couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie
347.28  used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book <i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss
347.29  Cummins, author of <i>Mabel Vaughan</i> and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams
347.30  that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from
347.31  Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write
347.32  her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did
347.33  not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there
347.34  she kept her girlish treasures trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary
347.35  badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and
347.36  the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there
347.37  were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's
348.01  of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only
348.02  express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had
348.03  copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. <i>Art
348.04  thou real, my ideal?</i> it was called by Louis J. Walsh, Magherafelt, and after
348.05  there was something about <i>twilight, wilt thou ever?</i> and ofttimes the beauty of
348.06  poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears
348.07  that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
348.08  shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident
348.09  coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end
348.10  she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back
348.11  for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her
348.12  every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would
348.13  she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the allimportant
348.14  question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who
348.15  had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name
348.16  from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be
348.17  kind. But even if -- what then? Would it make a very great difference? From
348.18  everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She
348.19  loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside
348.20  the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men, with no respect for a
348.21  girl's honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No,
348.22  no: not that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister
348.23  without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.
348.24  Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond
348.25  recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand him because
348.26  men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands
348.27  stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would follow her
348.28  dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the
348.29  only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. Nothing else
348.30  mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.</p>
348.31  <p>Canon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
348.32  the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then he locked the tabernacle
348.33  door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat
348.34  to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
348.35  <p>--O, look, Cissy!</p>
348.36  <p>And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over
348.37  the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.</p>
349.01  <p>--It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.</p>
349.02  <p>And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
349.03  helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
349.04  Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.</p>
349.05  <p>--Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.</p>
349.06  <p>But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and
349.07  call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from
349.08  where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.
349.09  She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon
349.10  her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave and it had
349.11  made her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass
349.12  remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man,
349.13  a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working
349.14  and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the
349.15  fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking
349.16  up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her
349.17  graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded,
349.18  and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because
349.19  she knew  about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple
349.20  told her once in dead secret and made her swear she'd never about the
349.21  gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts
349.22  Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers
349.23  and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine
349.24  sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that
349.25  because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her
349.26  face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there
349.27  was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being married
349.28  and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your
349.29  telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy
349.30  look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad
349.31  about actors' photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing
349.32  coming on the way it did.</p>
349.33  <p>And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back
349.34  and the garters were blue to match on account of  the transparent and they all
349.35  saw it and  shouted to look, look there it was and she leaned back ever so far
349.36  to see the fireworks and something queer was flying about through the air, a
349.37  soft thing to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over
350.01  the trees up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement
350.02  as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to
350.03  look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with
350.04  a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other
350.05  things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than
350.06  those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being
350.07  white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it
350.08  went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being
350.09  bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one
350.10  ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't
350.11  either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight
350.12  of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so
350.13  immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would
350.14  fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come,
350.15  to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little
350.16  strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And
350.17  then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle
350.18  burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and
350.19  it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah!
350.20  they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely! O so soft,
350.21  sweet, soft!</p>
350.22  <p>Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She
350.23  glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous
350.24  protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He was leaning
350.25  back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with
350.26  bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it
350.27  again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how
350.28  had he answered? An utter cad he had been. He of all men! But there was an
350.29  infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even
350.30  though he had erred and sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a
350.31  thousand times no. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding
350.32  twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so
350.33  softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell.</p>
350.34  <p>Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
350.35  what a great person she was: and then she cried:</p>
350.36  <p>--Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.</p>
350.37  <p>Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into her
351.01  kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without
351.02  letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too far to. She rose. Was
351.03  it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she
351.04  would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew
351.05  herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the
351.06  eyes that  reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her
351.07  sweet flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a
351.08  smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.</p>
351.09  <p>Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
351.10  to Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker
351.11  now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.
351.12  She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and
351.13  very slowly because, because Gerty MacDowell was .....</p>
351.14  <p>Tight boots? No. She's lame! O!</p>
351.15  <p>Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's
351.16  left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong
351.17  by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman.
351.18  But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on show. Hot
351.19  little devil all the same. Wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a nun or a negress or
351.20  a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect,
351.21  makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today. Where did I put
351.22  the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl
351.23  in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad
351.24  in the end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha,
351.25  she. Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all women
351.26  menstruate at the same time with  same moon, I mean? Depends on the time they
351.27  were born, I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly
351.28  and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn't do it
351.29  in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter. Made up
351.30  for that tramdriver this morning. That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say
351.31  nothing. And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.
351.32  Thankful for small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they
351.33  want it themselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured
351.34  out of offices. Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive,
351.35  O. Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that?
351.36  Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's
351.37  hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a
352.01  fake. <i>Lingerie</i> does it. Felt for the curves inside her <i>deshabillé</i>. Excites them
352.02  also when they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing
352.03  one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. At first.
352.04  Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet
352.05  garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.
352.06  He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was
352.07  shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin
352.08  she takes out. Pinned together. O Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the
352.09  nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when you're
352.10  on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No
352.11  reasonable offer refused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow
352.12  when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They
352.13  believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an
352.14  odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other's necks or with ten fingers
352.15  locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.
352.16  Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coif and their rosaries going up and down,
352.17  vindictive too for what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to
352.18  me. And I'll write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till
352.19  Mr Right comes, along then meet once in a blue moon. <i>Tableau!</i> O, look who
352.20  it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing
352.21  with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each
352.22  other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls showing their teeth at
352.23  one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each other a pinch of
352.24  salt.</p>
352.25  <p>Ah!</p>
352.26  <p>Devils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.
352.27  Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot.
352.28  O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a
352.29  way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns
352.30  milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read in
352.31  a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's a flirt. All
352.32  are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that you often meet what you
352.33  feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting:
352.34  collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time might
352.35  prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No.
352.36  Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw
352.37  something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet
353.01  chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid
353.02  gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn't let
353.03  her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men
353.04  marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly. Took off her
353.05  hat to show her hair. Wide brim bought to hide her face, meeting someone
353.06  might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong
353.07  in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in
353.08  Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a
353.09  prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more a pound. What? I think so. All that
353.10  for nothing. Bold hand. Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that
353.11  letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn. And the day I went to Drimmie's
353.12  without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember.
353.13  Richie Goulding. He's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped
353.14  at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean could do it myself. Save.
353.15  Was that just when he, she?</p>
353.16  <p>O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.</p>
353.17  <p>Ah!</p>
353.18  <p>Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that
353.19  little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. After effect not pleasant.
353.20  Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented
353.21  perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the
353.22  kiddies. Well, aren't they. See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting,
353.23  the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. <i>Amours</i> of actresses. Nell
353.24  Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver
353.25  effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come
353.26  and kiss me. Still I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it.
353.27  Good job I let off there behind coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was.
353.28  Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. <i>Lacaus esant taratara.</i>
353.29  Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however of you don't know
353.30  how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another.
353.31  Good idea if you're  in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening,
353.32  and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the
353.33  Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl
353.34  in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say all wrong of
353.35  course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't
353.36  answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And
353.37  kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the
354.01  button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her
354.02  mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they
354.03  enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with
354.04  me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in
354.05  the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my
354.06  pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't
354.07  think. Come in. All is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How
354.08  they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like
354.09  mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what
354.10  someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went
354.11  the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too.
354.12  Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry
354.13  off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else
354.14  all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he
354.15  and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside
354.16  them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are
354.17  best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed
354.18  her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her
354.19  breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when
354.20  we drove home the featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord
354.21  mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.</p>
354.22  <p>There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up
354.23  like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting
354.24  for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother's clothes.
354.25  Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with
354.26  the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made
354.27  for that. Like Molly. Why that high class whore in Jammet's wore her veil only
354.28  to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I'll tell you
354.29  the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every
354.30  morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of
354.31  the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.</p>
354.32  <p>Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give
354.33  that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyes
354.34  she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.
354.35  Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's jump. Women
354.36  never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus
354.37  with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife
355.01  has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked <i>Wet Paint.</i>
355.02  Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get
355.03  the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the
355.04  man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
355.05  twigged at once he had a false arm. Had too. Where do they get that? Typist
355.06  going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings.
355.07  Handed down from father to mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone.
355.08  Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.
355.09  Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent her
355.10  for Molly's Paisley shawl to Presscott's, by the way that ad I must, carrying
355.11  home the change in her stocking. Clever little minx! I never told her. Neat
355.12  way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up
355.13  her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did
355.14  you learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they
355.15  know? Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable just before
355.16  we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows?
355.17  Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the
355.18  other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf.
355.19  Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today.
355.20  A.E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef
355.21  to the heel.</p>
355.22  <p>A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and
355.23  zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy  ran out to see and Edy after with
355.24  the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch!
355.25  Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw your. I saw
355.26  all.</p>
355.27  <p>Lord!</p>
355.28  <p>Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For this
355.29  relief much thanks. In <i>Hamlet</i>, that is. Lord! It was all things combined.
355.30  Excitement. When she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.
355.31  Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a worse fool of myself
355.32  however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still it was
355.33  a kind of language between us. It couldn't be? No, Gerty they called her.
355.34  Might be false name however like my  and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.</p>
355.35  <p><i>Her maiden name was Jemima Brown</i></p>
355.36  <p><i>And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.</i></p>
356.01  <p>Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.
356.02  Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it
356.03  understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything
356.04  straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however because it lasts only
356.05  a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa's pants will soon fit
356.06  Willy and fullers' earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. No
356.07  soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harm's way. Nature. Washing child,
356.08  washing corpse. Dignam. Children's hands always round them. Cocoanut
356.09  skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted
356.10  curds. Oughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with
356.11  wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan
356.12  there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee
356.13  Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs
356.14  Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night
356.15  Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub
356.16  off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.
356.17  Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to
356.18  fault the husband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another
356.19  like glue. Maybe the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots
356.20  off them. It is the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure.
356.21  Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife
356.22  locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then
356.23  they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her.
356.24  Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling
356.25  in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the
356.26  dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls,
356.27  height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them He
356.28  matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought
356.29  makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and
356.30  repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is
356.31  not back. Better detach.</p>
356.32  <p>Ow!</p>
356.33  <p>Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the
356.34  short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches
356.35  are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the
356.36  person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose at once. Cat's away
356.37  the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism.
357.01  Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.
357.02  That causes movement. And time? Well that's the time the movement takes.
357.03  Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because
357.04  it's all arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the
357.05  stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come.
357.06  Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look
357.07  and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're a man to see
357.08  that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in
357.09  you. Tip. Have to let fly.</p>
357.10  <p>Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third
357.11  person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck
357.12  out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse
357.13  show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice that
357.14  fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did, like flowers. It was too.
357.15  Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make their own use
357.16  of everything. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they
357.17  wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing
357.18  up for hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.</p>
357.19  <p>Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I
357.20  leave you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it?
357.21  Heliotrope? No, Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that
357.22  kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her
357.23  with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance
357.24  night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing
357.25  her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it?
357.26  Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance if you go
357.27  into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only
357.28  now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's ever
357.29  so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice
357.30  islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is.
357.31  It's like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
357.32  call it gossamer and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything,
357.33  rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp
357.34  of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby
357.35  till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her
357.36  smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream.
357.37  Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because
358.01  you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of
358.02  ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails one grain pour off odour
358.03  for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you
358.04  sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look
358.05  at it that way. We're the same. Some women for instance warn you off when
358.06  they have their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat
358.07  on. Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the
358.08  grass.</p>
358.09  <p>Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves Long
358.10  John had on his desk the other. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that.
358.11  No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are
358.12  supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle.
358.13  Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden priest. O
358.14  father, will you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the
358.15  body, permeates. Source of life and it's extremely curious the smell. Celery
358.16  sauce. Let me.</p>
358.17  <p>Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his
358.18  waistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.</p>
358.19  <p>O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never
358.20  went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this
358.21  morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention
358.22  Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and nine.
358.23  Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you?
358.24  Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another
358.25  time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run up a bill on the
358.26  slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.</p>
358.27  <p>Here's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went
358.28  as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a
358.29  good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a
358.30  mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after
358.31  him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn
358.32  something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't mock what
358.33  matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. <i>The Mystery</i>
358.34  <i>Man on the Beach,</i> prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the
358.35  rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in the
358.36  brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all
358.37  the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the
359.01  Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the
359.02  rack. Mother Shipton's prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the
359.03  twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem
359.04  coming nigh.</p>
359.05  <p>Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or
359.06  they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace darling. People afraid of the
359.07  dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds flash better.
359.08  Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than
359.09  long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still
359.10  two types there are you bob  against. Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best
359.11  time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays
359.12  are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
359.13  indigo, violet. A star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two, when three it's night.
359.14  Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No.
359.15  Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun
359.16  this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land, goodnight.</p>
359.17  <p>Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white
359.18  fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up
359.19  through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the
359.20  mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst, Friction of the position. Like to be
359.21  that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't know how nice you looked.
359.22  I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose
359.23  it's the only time we cross legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl
359.24  graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it's the evening influence. They
359.25  feel all that. Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem
359.26  artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in
359.27  Mat Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length
359.28  oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns. History
359.29  repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again. Life, love, voyage
359.30  round your own little world. And now? Sad about her lame of course but must
359.31  be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.</p>
359.32  <p>All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The
359.33  rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums and I the plumstones.
359.34  Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that's all.
359.35  Lovers: yum yum.</p>
359.36  <p>Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of
359.37  me, little wretch. She kissed me. My youth. Never again. Only once it comes.
360.01  Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like
360.02  kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under the
360.03  sun. Care of P.O. Dolphin's barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty
360.04  darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house. Mat Dillon and his
360.05  bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too.
360.06  Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old major partial to his drop
360.07  of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think
360.08  you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way
360.09  home. And just when he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van
360.10  Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan
360.11  delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle
360.12  coming back. She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty
360.13  years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old.
360.14  His gun rusty from the drew.</p>
360.15  <p>Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree,
360.16  so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could be
360.17  changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny
360.18  little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by
360.19  his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems
360.20  to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray for us. And pray
360.21  for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy
360.22  from us. Yes, there's the light in the priest's house. Their frugal meal.
360.23  Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom's.
360.24  Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate.
360.25  Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out  at night like mice. They're a mixed
360.26  breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better
360.27  sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by
360.28  throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny
360.29  bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend
360.30  on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a
360.31  shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.
360.32  Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you
360.33  never see them with three colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell
360.34  in the <i>City Arms</i> with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different
360.35  colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that wise
360.36  man what's his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire.
360.37  It can't be tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the
361.01  wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the
361.02  sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.</p>
361.03  <p>Ba. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last
361.04  week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be
361.05  the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too never find out what they say. Like
361.06  our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have to fly over the ocean
361.07  and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors
361.08  have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark,
361.09  lowing out like seacows. <i>Faugh a ballagh.</i> Out of that, bloody curse to you.
361.10  Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake
361.11  when the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the
361.12  ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round. Wife in
361.13  every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes
361.14  marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How
361.15  can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with a
361.16  scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well? And the tephilim no what's this
361.17  they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. That brought us out
361.18  of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those
361.19  superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on
361.20  to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round round him, gulping
361.21  salt water, and that's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.
361.22  Do fish ever get seasick?</p>
361.23  <p>Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew
361.24  and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker. Moon looking down.  Not my
361.25  fault, old cockalorum.</p>
361.26  <p>A lost long candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of
361.27  funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet
361.28  but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd's hour: the
361.29  hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome
361.30  double knock, went the nine o'clock postman, the glowworm's lamp at his
361.31  belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five
361.32  young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of
361.33  lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: <i>Evening
361.34  Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!</i> and from the door of
361.35  Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew
361.36  there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for
361.37  slumber tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt
362.01  gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye
362.02  unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on
362.03  Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.</p>
362.04  <p>Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights
362.05  board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy and
362.06  lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin's King, throwing
362.07  them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to
362.08  shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the
362.09  women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf  loose,
362.10  laughing. Don't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean.
362.11  But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't
362.12  want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks
362.13  too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only
362.14  half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim
362.15  guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids. Only troubles wildfire
362.16  and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep
362.17  with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another themselves?
362.18  But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt.
362.19  I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that
362.20  the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first
362.21  stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one
362.22  is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart. Padding themselves
362.23  out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.
362.24  Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange
362.25  moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from
362.26  Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that
362.27  gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.
362.28  Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.
362.29  I always thought I'd marry a lord or a  gentleman  with a private yacht. <i>Buenas
362.30  noches, señorita. El hombre ama la muchaha hermosa.</i> Why me? Because you
362.31  were so foreign from the others.</p>
362.32  <p>Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you dull.
362.33  Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for <i>Leah, Lily of
362.34  Killarney</i>. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see. Hope she's over.
362.35  Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of keys, museum with
362.36  those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my
362.37  own back there. Drunken ranters. What I said about his God made him wince.
363.01  Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.
363.02  Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two.
363.03  Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not
363.04  to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law
363.05  he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly
363.06  nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo
363.07  has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range.
363.08  Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam's
363.09  put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never
363.10  know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish widows as
363.11  I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to pop off first.
363.12  That widow on Monday was is outside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried
363.13  the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's
363.14  mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along.
363.15  Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five
363.16  children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good
363.17  matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter
363.18  face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flanelette bloomers, three shillings a pair,
363.19  astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no
363.20  woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See
363.21  him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. U.p:
363.22  up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog
363.23  it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on.
363.24  Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does. Would I like her in pyjamas?
363.25  Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now.
363.26  Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly.
363.27  She has something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.</p>
363.28  <p>Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He
363.29  brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go. Better.
363.30  I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles.
363.31  Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story of a
363.32  treasure in it thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw
363.33  things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's this? Bit of
363.34  stick.</p>
363.35  <p>O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here
363.36  tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do.
363.37  Will I?</p>
364.01  <p>Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a
364.02  message for her. Might remain. What?</p>
364.03  <p>I.</p>
364.04  <p>Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide
364.05  comes here a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror,
364.06  breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those
364.07  transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that other
364.08  world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.</p>
364.09  <p>AM. A.</p>
364.10  <p>No room. Let it go.</p>
364.11  <p>Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.
364.12  Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except
364.13  Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.</p>
364.14  <p>He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now
364.15  if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance. We'll
364.16  never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so
364.17  young.</p>
364.18  <p>Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.
364.19  Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won't
364.20  go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment.
364.21  Won't sleep though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm
364.22  in him. Just a few.</p>
364.23  <p>O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do
364.24  love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him
364.25  pike hoses frillies for Raoul to perfume your wife black hair heave under embon
364.26  <i>señorita</i> young eyes Mulvey plump  years  dreams return tail end Agendath swoony
364.27  lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.</p>
364.28  <p>A bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom
364.29  with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just for a few</p>
364.30  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
364.31  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
364.32  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
364.33  <p>The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon
364.34  O'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. were taking
365.01  tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking
365.02  about</p>
365.03  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
365.04  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
365.05  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
365.06  <p>Because it was a little canarybird bird that came out of its little house to
365.07  tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because
365.08  she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell,
365.09  and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the
365.10  rocks looking was</p>
365.11  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
365.12  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
365.13  <p><i>Cuckoo.</i></p>
