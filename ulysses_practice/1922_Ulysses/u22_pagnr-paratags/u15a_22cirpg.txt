men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged
lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children.

muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and
snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches
to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky
oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his
booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone
makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on
the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts,
clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both
hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two
night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters,
loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths
of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from
warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs
out the tatts from the hair of a scrufulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice,

of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of
those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's
perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of
my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in

to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to
nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months child he had been
carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There
might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over
a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to
lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate

This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal
disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this
439
a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who
started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The
trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity,
brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh.
<i>Prima facie,</i> I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing.
Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her
virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal in especial with atavism.
There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family.
If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that
have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord,
is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of
Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.</p>

hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute
Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the
world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to

or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard,
responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants

overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following

se|?norita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him
from nature) practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a
blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of

from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from
his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile
debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This
vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the
Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of
his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!</p>

abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for
demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the
consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered
among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism.
Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely
idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence
of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to
be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination
and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and
pubic hairs, I declare him to be <i>virgo intacta</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>Reads a bill of health.</i>) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new
womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found
466
him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole,
coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really
beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed
Priests Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total
abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most
Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer
and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a
firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he
was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most
sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about
to have a baby.</p>
<p>(<i>General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American

          <p><sc>the nymph</sc></p>
<p>I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above
your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places.
And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Humbly kisses her long hair.</i>) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I
was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.</p>

<p>During dark nights I heard your praise.</p>

<p>(<i>Quickly.</i>) Yes, yes. You mean that I ... Sleep reveals the worst side of
everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was
pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English
invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed.
It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (<i>He sighs.</i>) 'Twas ever thus.

The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.</p>

<p>(<i>Reflects precautiously.</i>) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight.
She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It

little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom

crushes, instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice.
Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that
summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.</p>

<p>I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest.
The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction
is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night
toilette trough illclosed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate
grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow
of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I ... A saint couldn't

<p>It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where

Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.</p>
          <p><sc>stephen</sc></p>
<p>Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing

at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from
the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within
the hall urges on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum
kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent
lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom,
parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries
down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Raschid, he flits
behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step
of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in
aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds led by

<p>I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to ...</p>
          <p><sc>corny kelleher</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Laughs.</i>) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God,
says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (<i>He laughs again and leers
with lacklustre eye.</i>) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do
you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Tries to laugh.</i>) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old
friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up
for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my
way home ...</p>
<p>(<i>The horse neighs.</i>)</p>
          <p><sc>the horse</sc></p>
<p>Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!</p>
          <p><sc>corny kelleher</sc></p>
<p>Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two
commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (<i>He
laughs.</i>) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where
does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?</p>
563
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.</p>
<p>(<i>Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the
horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.</i>)</p>
          <p><sc>corny kelleher</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Scratches his nape.</i>) Sandycove! (<i>He bends down and calls to Stephen.</i>) Eh!
(<i>He calls again.</i>) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they
didn't lift anything off him.</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.</p>
          <p><sc>corny kelleher</sc></p>
<p>Ah, well he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (<i>He
laughs.</i>) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!</p>
          <p><sc>the horse</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Neighs.</i>) Hohohohohome.</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few ...</p>
<p>(<i>Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse
harness jingles.</i>)</p>
          <p><sc>corny kelleher</sc></p>
<p>(<i>From the car, standing.</i>) Night.</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>(<i>The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The
car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on
the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom's plight.
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from
the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With
thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will
allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow
564
nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen
needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom
lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with
his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The
tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo
looloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen's hat festooned with
shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and
shakes him by the shoulder.</i>)</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>Eh! Ho! (<i>There is no answer; he bends again.</i>) Mr Dedalus! (<i>There is no
answer.</i>) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (<i>He bends again and, hesitating,
brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.</i>) Stephen! (<i>There is no
answer. He calls again.</i>) Stephen!</p>
          <p><sc>stephen</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Groans.</i>) Who? Black panther vampire. (<i>He sighs and stretches himself,
then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.</i>)</p>
<p>Who ... drive ... Fergus now.</p>
<p>And pierce ... wood's woven shade? ...</p>
<p>(<i>He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.</i>)</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (<i>He bends again and undoes the buttons of
Stephen's waistcoat.</i>) To breathe. (<i>He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen's clothes
with light hands and fingers.</i>) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (<i>He listens.</i>)
What!</p>
          <p><sc>stephen</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Murmurs.</i>)</p>
<p>... shadows ... the woods.</p>
<p>... white breast ... dim ...</p>
<p>(<i>He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding
his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom
tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on
Stephen's face and form.</i>)</p>
565
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Communes with the night.</i>) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the
shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some
girl. Best thing could happen him ... (<i>He murmurs.</i>) ... swear that I will always
hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts ... (<i>He murmurs.</i>) ...
in the rough sands of the sea ... a cabletow's length from the shore ... where
the tide ebbs ... and flows ...</p>
<p>(<i>Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in
the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears
slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an
Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book
in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the
page.</i>)</p>
          <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.</i>) Rudy!</p>
          <p><sc>rudy</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.
He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and ruby
buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet
bowknot. A white lambskin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.</i>)</p>
