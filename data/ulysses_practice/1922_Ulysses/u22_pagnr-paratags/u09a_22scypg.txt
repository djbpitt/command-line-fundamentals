<p>Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:</p>
<p>--And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of <i>Wilhelm Meister?</i>
A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea
of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.</p>
<p>He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.</p>
<p>A noiseless attendant, setting open the door but slightly, made him a
noiseless beck.</p>
<p>--Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful
ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels
that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.</p>
<p>Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door
he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was gone.</p>
<p>Two left.</p>
<p>--Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
before his death.</p>
<p>--Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
elder's gall, to write <i>Paradise Lost</i> at your dictation? <i>The Sorrows of Satan</i>
he calls it.</p>
<p>Smile. Smile Cranly's smile.</p>
<p><i>First he tickled her</i></p>
<p><i>Then he patted her</i></p>
<p><i>Then he passed the female catheter</i></p>
<p><i>For he was a medical</i></p>
<p><i>Jolly old medi</i> ...</p>
177
<p>--I feel you would need one more for <i>Hamlet</i>. Seven is dear to the
mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.</p>
<p>Glittereyed, his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the
face, bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low: a
sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.</p>
<p><i>Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood</i></p>
<p><i>Tears such as angels weep.</i></p>
<p><i>Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.</i></p>
<p>He holds my follies hostage.</p>
<p>Cranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed
Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one
more to hail him: <i>ave, rabbi</i>. The Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glen
he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him, night by night. Godspeed.
Good hunting.</p>
<p>Mulligan has my telegram.</p>
<p>Folly. Persist.</p>
<p>--Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a
figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though
I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.</p>
<p>--All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergy-//men's
discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas,
formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out of
how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting
of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our mind
into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the
speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.</p>
<p>A.E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!</p>
<p>--The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.
Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.</p>
<p>--And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.</p>
178
<p>He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.</p>
<p>Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly
man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us
at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar. I am the
sacrificial butter.</p>
<p>Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
Ineffable, in heaven hight, K.H., their master, whose identity is no secret to
adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can
help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born of en ensouled
virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi. The life esoteric
is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper
Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H.P.B's elemental.</p>
<p>O, fie! Out on't! <i>Pfuiteufel!</i> You naughtn't to look, missus, so you
naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.</p>
<p>Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p>
<p>--That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings
about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undram-//atic
monologue, as shallow as Plato's.</p>
<p>John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:</p>
<p>--Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare
Aristotle with Plato.</p>
<p>--Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth?</p>
<p>Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.
Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very
peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller
than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into
eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the
here, through which all future plunges to the past.</p>
<p>Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.</p>
<p>--Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p>--Is he?</p>
<p>--I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't
you know, about Hyde's <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>. I couldn't bring him in to
hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.</p>
179
<p><i>Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick</i></p>
<p><i>To greet the callous public.</i></p>
<p><i>Writ, I ween, 'twas not my wish</i></p>
<p><i>In lean unlovely English.</i></p>
<p>--The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.</p>
<p>We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.</p>
<p>--People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg
of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world
are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside. For
them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefied
air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the music-//hall
song, France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the
desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer's
Phæacians.</p>
<p>From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.</p>
<p>--Mallarmé, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
<i>Hamlet</i>. He says: <i>il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même</i>, don't you know,
<i>reading the book of himself</i>. He describes <i>Hamlet</i> given in a French town, don't
you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p>His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.</p>
<p><i>Hamlet</i></p>
<p><i>ou</i></p>
<p><i>Le Distrait</i></p>
<p><i>Pièce de Shakespeare</i></p>
<p>He repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:</p>
<p>--<i>Pièce de Shakespeare</i>, don't you know. It's so French, the French point
of view. <i>Hamlet ou</i> ...</p>
<p>--The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.</p>
<p>John Eglinton laughed.</p>
<p>--Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but
distressingly shortsighted in some matters.</p>
<p>Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.</p>
180
<p>--A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not
for nothing was he a butcher's son wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting
in his palm. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one, Our Father who art
in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles
in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.</p>
<p>Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.</p>
<p><i>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none</i></p>
<p><i>But we had spared</i> ...</p>
<p>Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.</p>
<p>--He will have it that <i>Hamlet</i> is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for
Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh
creep.</p>
<p><i>List! List! O list!</i></p>
<p>My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.</p>
<p><i>If thou didst ever</i> ...</p>
<p>--What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has
faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies
from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from <i>limbo patrum,</i> returning to the
world that has forgotten him? Who is king Hamlet?</p>
<p>John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p>
<p>Lifted.</p>
<p>--It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.
The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers
who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.</p>
<p>Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.</p>
<p>--Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks by
the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying
her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.</p>
<p>Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!</p>
181
<p>--The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the ghost,
the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied
<i>Hamlet</i> all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the
part of the spectre. He speaks the words  to Burbage, the young player who
stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:</p>
<p><i>Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit</i></p>
<p>bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young
Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in
Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p>Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the
vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his
own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince
Hamlet's twin) is it possible,  I want to know, or probable that he did not
draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossesed
son: I am the murdered father:  your mother is the guilty queen, Ann
Shakespeare, born Hathaway?</p>
<p>--But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently.</p>
<p>Art thou there, truepenny?</p>
<p>--Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I
mean when we read the poetry of <i>King Lear</i> what is it to us how the poet
lived? As for living, our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l'Isle has said.
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet's drinking,
the poet's debts. We have <i>King Lear:</i> and it is immortal.</p>
<p>Mr Best's face appealed to, agreed.</p>
<p><i>Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan,</i></p>
<p><i>Mananaan MacLir</i> .....</p>
<p>How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?</p>
<p>Marry, I wanted it.</p>
<p>Take thou this noble.</p>
<p>Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's
daughter. Agenbite of inwit.</p>
182
<p>Do you intend to pay it back?</p>
<p>O, yes.</p>
<p>When? Now?</p>
<p>Well ... no.</p>
<p>When, then?</p>
<p>I paid my way. I paid my way.</p>
<p>Steady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You
owe it.</p>
<p>Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got
pound.</p>
<p>Buzz. Buzz.</p>
<p>But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under ever-//changing
forms.</p>
<p>I that sinned and prayed and fasted.</p>
<p>A child Conmee saved from pandies.</p>
<p>I, I and I. I.</p>
<p>A.E.I.O.U.</p>
<p>--Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?
John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.</p>
<p>--She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She
saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore  his
children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he
lay on his deathbed.</p>
<p>Mother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into
this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <i>Liliata rutilantium.</i></p>
<p>I wept alone.</p>
<p>John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p>
<p>--The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.</p>
<p>--Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p>Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted,
bald, eared and assiduous.</p>
<p>--A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from
Xanthippe?</p>
183
<p>--Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring
thoughts into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto <i>(absit
nomen!)</i> Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.
But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the
archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.</p>
<p>--But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we
seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p>His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to chide
them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guitless though
maligned.</p>
<p>--He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant
memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville
whistling <i>The girl I left behind me</i>. If the earthquake did not time it we should
know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the
studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, <i>Venus and Adonis,</i> lay
in the bechamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew
illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer
of <i>Antony and Cleopatra,</i> a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his
head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal.
Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are
the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He
chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann
hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet
and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who
tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.</p>
<p>And my turn? When?</p>
<p>Come!</p>
<p>--Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly.</p>
<p>He murmured then with blond delight for all:</p>
<p><i>Between the acres of the rye</i></p>
<p><i>These pretty countryfolk would lie.</i></p>
<p>Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.</p>
184
<p>A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
cooperative watch.</p>
<p>--I am afraid I am due at the <i>Homestead</i>.</p>
<p>Whither away? Exploitable ground.</p>
<p>--Are you going, John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see
you at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.</p>
<p>--Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?</p>
<p>Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.</p>
<p>--I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get
away in time.</p>
<p>Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. <i>Isis Unveiled.</i> Their Pali book we tried
to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec logos,
functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma. The faithful
hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him. Louis H.
Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies tend them i'the eyes, their pineal
glands aglow. Filled with his god he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer
of souls, engulfer. Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing
creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.</p>
<p><i>In quintessential triviality</i></p>
<p><i>For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.</i></p>
<p>--They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said,
friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of
our younger poets' verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.</p>
<p>Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted,
shone.</p>
<p>See this. Remember.</p>
<p>Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplant-//handle
over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with two index
fingers. Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is that in virtue of which
it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal, one hat is one hat.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
Longworth will give it a good puff in the <i>Express</i>. O, will he? I liked Colum's
<i>Drover</i>. Yes, I think he has that queer thing, genius. Do you think he has
genius really? Yeats admired his line: <i>As in wild earth a Grecian vase</i>. Did he?
185
I hope you'll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore
asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore
and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They
remind one of don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to
be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful
countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes,
he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is
doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.</p>
<p>Cordelia. <i>Cordoglio.</i> Lir's loneliest daughter.</p>
<p>Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.</p>
<p>--Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will
be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman .....</p>
<p>--O, yes. If he considers it important  it will go in. We have so much
correspondence.</p>
<p>--I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.</p>
<p>God ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.</p>
<p>Synge has promised me an article for <i>Dana</i> too. Are we going to be read?
I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you will
come round tonight. Bring Starkey.</p>
<p>Stephen sat down.</p>
<p>The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing his mask said:</p>
<p>--Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p>He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:</p>
<p>--Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p>Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?</p>
<p>--Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering.</p>
<p>--Yes.</p>
<p>Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks from
hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women he won
to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters'
wives. Fox and geese. And in New place a slack dishonoured body that once
was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all,
bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.</p>
<p>--Yes. So you think ...</p>
<p>The door closed behind the outgoer.</p>
186
<p>Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air.</p>
<p>A vestal's lamp.</p>
<p>Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to
do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the
possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he
lived among women.</p>
<p>Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of
words. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the
voice of that Egyptian highpriest. <i>In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks.</i></p>
<p>They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death
is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.</p>
<p>--Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much.
Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p>--But <i>Hamlet</i> is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of
private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean I don't care a button,
don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty ...</p>
<p>He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance.
His private papers in the original. <i>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim imo shagart.</i>
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.</p>
<p>Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:</p>
<p>--I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but
I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare
is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.</p>
<p>Bear with me.</p>
<p>Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes, glinting stern under
wrinkled brows. A basilisk. <i>E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca.</i> Messer Brunetto, I
thank thee for the word.</p>
<p>--As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave
and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was
when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after
time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son
looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley
says, is a fading coal that which I was is that which I am and that which in
possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see
187
myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p>Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.</p>
<p>--Yes, Mr Best said youngly, I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.</p>
<p>Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.</p>
<p>--That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.</p>
<p>John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.</p>
<p>--If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a
drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan admired
so much breathe another spirit.</p>
<p>--The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.</p>
<p>--There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering.</p>
<p>Said that.</p>
<p>--If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of <i>King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,</i> look to see
when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked
in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?</p>
<p>Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.</p>
<p>--A child, a girl placed in his arms, Marina.</p>
<p>--The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to
the town.</p>
<p>Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers
going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good masters?
Mummed in names: A.E, eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west
of the moon: <i>Tir na n-og</i>. Booted the twain and staved.</p>
<p><i>How many miles to Dublin?</i></p>
<p><i>Three score and ten, sir.</i></p>
<p><i>Will we be there by candlelight?</i></p>
<p>--Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.</p>
<p>--Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus, as some
aver his name is, say of it?</p>
<p>--Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's child.
188
<i>My dearest wife,</i> Pericles says, <i>was like this maid</i>. Will any man love the daughter
if he has not loved the mother?</p>
<p>--The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. <i>L'art d'être grand</i> ...</p>
<p>--His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard
of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The
images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque
attempts of nature to foretell or  repeat himself.</p>
<p>The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.</p>
<p>--I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George
Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
Shakespeare in the <i>Saturday Review</i> were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too
draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The
favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet
must be rejected, such a rejection would seem more in harmony with -- what
shall I say? -- our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p>Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize
of their fray.</p>
<p>He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam?
Dost love thy man?</p>
<p>--That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of Goethe's which
Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a <i>buonaroba</i>, a bay
where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling
to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a
coistrel gentleman and  had written <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why? Belief in himself has
been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should
say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously
the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.
No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has
wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there
remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some
goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first,
darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and
the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.</p>
<p>They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.</p>
<p>--The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
189
porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know
the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that
knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs
that urged it king Hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not endowed
with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely
English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he
would but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to
Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the
creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has
revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's
rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him
who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p>
<p>--Amen!  responded from the doorway.</p>
<p>Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p>
<p><i>Entr'acte.</i></p>
<p>A ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe
in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.</p>
<p>--You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he
asked of Stephen.</p>
<p>Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.</p>
<p>They make him welcome. <i>Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen.</i></p>
<p>Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.</p>
<p>He Who Himself begot, middler the Holy Ghost, and Himself sent Himself,
Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped
and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let
Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen
hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in
the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead
already.</p>

<p>He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.</p>
<p>--Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.
Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.
All sides of life should be represented.</p>
<p>He smiled on all sides equally.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:</p>
<p>--Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p>
<p>A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.</p>
<p>--To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like
Synge.</p>
<p>Mr Best turned to him:</p>
<p>--Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after
at the D.B.C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>.</p>
<p>--I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?</p>
<p>--The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather
tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played
Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held
that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman?
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness
not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.</p>
<p>--The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said, lifting
his brilliant notebook. That <i>Portrait of Mr W.H.</i> where he proves that the
sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.</p>
<p>--For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.</p>
<p>Or Hughie Wills. Mr William Himself. W.H: who am I?</p>
<p>--I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of
course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues the colour,
but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very essence of Wilde, don't
you know. The light touch.</p>
<p>His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame
essence of Wilde.</p>
<p>You're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
Deasy's ducats.</p>
<p>How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.</p>
<p>For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.</p>
<p>Wit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks
in. Lineaments of gratified desire.</p>
191
<p>There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool
ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.</p>
<p>Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A shake coils her, fang in's kiss.</p>
<p>--Do you think it is only a paradox, the quaker librarian was asking.
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.</p>
<p>They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile
lips read, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p>--Telegram! He said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!</p>
<p>He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:</p>
<p>--<i>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense
debtorship for a thing done.</i> Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from?
The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is
going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, the
Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified kinchite!</p>
<p>Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in
querulous brogue:</p>
<p>--It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,
Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did
for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with
leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's
sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.</p>
<p>He wailed:</p>
<p>--And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us
your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like
the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.</p>
<p>Stephen laughed.</p>
<p>Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down:</p>
<p>--The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He
heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to
murder you.</p>
<p>--Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
ceiling.</p>
<p>--Murder you! he laughed.</p>
<p>Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of
192
lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin
with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.
<i>C'est vendredi saint!</i> Murthering Irish. His image, wandering, he met. I mine.
I met a fool i'the forest.</p>
<p>--Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.</p>
<p>--... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his
<i>Diary of Master Silence</i> has found the hunting terms ... Yes? What is it?</p>
<p>--There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
offering a card. From the <i>Freeman</i>. He wants to see the files of the <i>Kilkenny
People</i> for last year.</p>
<p>--Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman? ...</p>
<p>He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down, unglanced, looked,
asked, creaked, asked:</p>
<p>--Is he? ... O, there!</p>
<p>Brisk in a galliard he was off and out. In the daylit corridor he talked with
voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest
broadbrim.</p>
<p>--This gentleman? <i>Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?</i> To be sure.
Good day, sir. <i>Kilkenny</i> ... We have certainly ...</p>
<p>A patient silhouette waited, listening.</p>
<p>--All the leading provincial ... <i>Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy
Guardian,</i>  1903 ... Will you please? ... Evans, conduct this gentleman ... If
you just follow the atten ... Or please allow me ... This way ... Please, sir ...</p>
<p>Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark
figure following his hasty heels.</p>
<p>The door closed.</p>
<p>--The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried,</p>
<p>He jumped up and snatched the card.</p>
<p>--What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.</p>
<p>He rattled on.</p>
<p>--Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the
museum when I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that
has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. <i>Life
of life, thy lips enkindle.</i></p>
<p>Suddenly he turned to Stephen:</p>
<p>--He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker
than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus
193
Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! <i>The god pursuing the maiden hid.</i></p>
<p>--We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's
approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her,
if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.</p>
<p>--Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from
Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom
a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he
lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that
of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art
of feudalism, as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies,
green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,
ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million
francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor
had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there
between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul
pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick
Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in <i>Richard III</i> and how Shakespeare,
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's
blankets: <i>William the conqueror came before Richard III.</i> And the gay lakin,
mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich,
a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a
penny a time.</p>
<p>Cours-la-Reine. <i>Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. Minette?
Tu veux?</i></p>
<p>--The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford's
mother with her cup of canary for every cockcanary.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:</p>
<p>--Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!</p>
<p>--And Harry of six wives' daughter and other lady friends from
neighbour seats, as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those
twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind
the diamond panes?</p>
<p>Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter Lane of Gerard, herbalist,
he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno's eyes,
violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek of
lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.</p>
194
<p>Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.</p>
<p>--Whom do you suspect? he challenged.</p>
<p>--Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice
spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.</p>
<p>Love that dare not speak its name.</p>
<p>--As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved
a lord.</p>
<p>Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p>
<p>--It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank
in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her
favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. Sweet Ann I take it, was hot
in the blood. Once a wooer twice a wooer.</p>
<p>Stephen turned boldly in his chair.</p>
<p>--The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said, frowning. If
you deny that in the fifth scene of <i>Hamlet</i> he has branded her with infamy,
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between
the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw
their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear
Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go,
Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her
husband too while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy's words, wed
her second, having killed her first.</p>
<p>O yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal
London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father's
shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has
commended her to posterity.</p>
<p>He faced their silence.</p>
<p>To whom thus Eglinton:</p>
<p>You mean the will.</p>
<p>That has been explained, I believe, by jurists.</p>
<p>She was entitled to her widow's dower</p>
<p>At common law. His legal knowledge was great</p>
<p>Our judges tell us.</p>
195
<p>Him Satan fleers,</p>
<p>Mocker:</p>
<p>And therefore he left out her name</p>
<p>From the first draft but he did not leave out</p>
<p>The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,</p>
<p>For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford</p>
<p>And in London. And therefore when he was urged,</p>
<p>As I believe, to name her</p>
<p>He left her his</p>
<p>Secondbest</p>
<p>Bed.</p>
<p><i>Punkt</i></p>
<p>Leftherhis</p>
<p>Secondbest</p>
<p>Leftherhis</p>
<p>Bestabed</p>
<p>Secabest</p>
<p>Leftabed.</p>
<p>Woa!</p>
<p>--Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.</p>
<p>--He was a rich countrygentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms
and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist share-//holder,
a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best bed
if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?</p>
<p>--It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest,
Mr Secondbest Best said finely.</p>
<p>--<i>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo,</i> bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.</p>
<p>--Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling,
Let me think.</p>
<p>--Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen
sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves,
pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead
wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget Nell Gwynn
Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.</p>
196
<p>--Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean ...</p>
<p>--He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for
a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!</p>
<p>--What? asked Besteglinton.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For
terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house .....</p>
<p>--Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he
thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his
hands and said: <i>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days</i>. Lovely!</p>
<p>Catamite.</p>
<p>--The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
ugling Eglinton.</p>
<p>Steadfast John replied severe:</p>
<p>--The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your
cake and have it.</p>
<p>Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me the palm of beauty?</p>
<p>--And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his
own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a
cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle
Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for
the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for
every money lent. How else could Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick?
All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that
followed the hanging and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart
being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> with
the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.
The lost armada is his jeer in <i>Love's Labour Lost</i>. His pageants, the histories, sail
fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and
we have a porter's theory of equivocation. The <i>Sea Venture</i> comes home from
Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our
American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sydney's. As for fay Elizabeth,
otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired <i>The Merry Wives of
Windsor</i> let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid
meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.</p>
<p>I think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of
theolologicophilolological. <i>Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.</i></p>
197
<p>--Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your
dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.</p>
<p><i>Sufflaminandus sum.</i></p>
<p>--He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
polisher of Italian scandals.</p>
<p>--A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him
myriadminded.</p>
<p><i>Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter
multos.</i></p>
<p>--Saint Thomas, Stephen began ...</p>
<p>--<i>Ora pro nobis,</i> Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.</p>
<p>There he keened a wailing rune.</p>
<p>--<i>Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!</i> It's destroyed we are from this day!
It's destroyed we are surely!</p>
<p>All smiled their smiles.</p>
<p>--Saint Thomas, Stephen, smiling, said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of
the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way
to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the love so given to one near
in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers
for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given
to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which
built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was
shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins
or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at  doomsday leet. But a man who holds
so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold
tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. No
sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his
maidservant or his jackass.</p>
<p>--Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.</p>
<p>--Gentle will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.</p>
<p>--Which will! gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting
mixed.</p>
<p>--The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's
widow, is the will to die.</p>
<p>--<i>Requiescat!</i> Stephen prayed.</p>
198
<p><i>What of all the will to do?</i></p>
<p><i>It has vanished long ago</i> ...</p>
<p>--She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled
queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar
is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age
she takes up with gospellers (one stayed  at New Place and drank a quart of sack
the town  paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she
had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the <i>Merry
Wives</i> and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over <i>Hooks and
Eyes for Believers' Breeches</i> and <i>The Most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout
Souls Sneeze</i>. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse
of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p>--History shows that to be true, <i>inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos</i>. The ages
succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's worst
enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell is right.
What do we care for his wife and father? I should say that only family poets
have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his
supreme creation.</p>
<p>Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy supping
with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him.
Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman to see you.
Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor
Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned
codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of
wilding in his hand.</p>
<p>Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.</p>
<p>Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I
touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is
attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.</p>
<p>--A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil.
He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death. If you hold
that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive
years of life, <i>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita,</i> with fifty of experience is the
beardless undergraduate from Wittemberg then you must hold that his
seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakes-//peare
does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests,
199
disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child.
Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a
mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On
that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect
flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably
because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon
incertitude, upon unlikelihood, <i>Amor matris</i>, subjective and objective genitive,
may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is
the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?</p>
<p>What the hell are you driving at?</p>
<p>I know. Shut up. Blast you! I have reasons.</p>
<p><i>Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.</i></p>
<p>Are you condemned to do this?</p>
<p>--They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities hardly record
its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves
that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with
keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he
brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a  male: his growth is his
father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.</p>
<p>In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.</p>
<p>--What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p>
<p>Am I a father? If I were?</p>
<p>Shrunken uncertain hand.</p>
<p>--Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field,
held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with
whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the father who has
not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? When
Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the
comedy of errors wrote <i>Hamlet</i> he was not the father of his own son merely
but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race,
the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by
the same token, never was born for nature, as Mr Magee understands her,
abhors perfection.</p>
<p>Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing,
a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.</p>

<p>Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p>
<p>--Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with
child. I have an unborn child in  my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play's
the thing! Let me parturiate!</p>
<p>He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.</p>
<p>--As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest
of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in <i>Coriolanus.</i>
His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in <i>King John</i>. Hamlet,
the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in <i>The Tempest,</i> in
<i>Pericles,</i> in <i>Winter's Tale</i> are we know. Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and
Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there is another member of his
family who is recorded.</p>
<p>--The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p>The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with
haste, quake, quack.</p>
<p>Door closed. Cell. Day.</p>
<p>They list. Three. They.</p>
<p>I you he they.</p>
<p>Come, mess.</p>

<p>He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his old age
told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time
mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon
in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert's
soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the
works of sweet William.</p>
<p>M<sc>ageeglinjohn</sc></p>
<p>Names! What's in a name?</p>
<p>B<sc>est</sc></p>
<p>That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to say
a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake.</p>

<p><i>To his comrade medical Davy</i> ...</p>
<p>S<sc>tephen</sc></p>
<p>In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crook//back,
Edmund in <i>King Lear,</i> two bear the wicked uncles' names. Nay, that last
play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in
Southwark.</p>
<p>B<sc>est</sc></p>
<p>I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name ...</p>
<p><i>(Laughter.)</i></p>
<p>Q<sc>uakerlyster</sc></p>
<p><i>(A tempo.)</i> But he that filches from me my good name ...</p>
<p>S<sc>tephen</sc></p>
<p>(<i>Stringendo.</i>) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in
the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a
dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is
Will in overplus. Like John O'Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the
coat of arms he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorifi-//cabilitudinitatibus,
dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country.
What's in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write
the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake rose at his
birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night,
and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation
which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it,
lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous
summer fields at midnight, returning from Shottery and from her arms.</p>
<p>Both satisfied. I too.</p>
<p>Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.</p>
202
<p>And from her arms.</p>
<p>Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?</p>
<p>Read the skies. <i>Autontimerumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos.</i> Where's your
configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S.D: sua donna. <i>Già:
di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amar S.D.</i></p>
<p>--What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a
celestial phenomenon?</p>
<p>--A star by night, Stephen said, a pillar of the cloud by day.</p>
<p>What more's to speak?</p>
<p>Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.</p>
<i>Stephanos,</i> my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my
feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.</p>
<p>--You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own
name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.</p>
<p>Me, Magee and Mulligan.</p>
<p>Fabulous artificer, the hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-
Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. <i>Pater, ait.</i>
Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.</p>
<p>Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:</p>
<p>--That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know,
we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers
Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The third brother
that  marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.</p>
<p>Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.</p>
<p>The quaker librarian springhalted near.</p>
<p>--I should like to know, he said, which brother you ... I understand
you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers ... But perhaps
I am anticipating?</p>
<p>He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.</p>
<p>An attendant from the doorway called:</p>
<p>--Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants ...</p>
<p>--O! Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p>Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p>
<p>John Eglinton touched the foil.</p>
<p>--Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and
Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn't you?</p>
<p>--In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie
203
and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps.
A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p>
<p>Lapwing.</p>
<p>Where is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then
Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They
mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.</p>
<p>Lapwing.</p>
<p>I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>--You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which
he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the
conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other four
acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the
only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence, the angel of the world.
Why is the underplot of <i>King Lear</i> in which Edmund figures lifted out of
Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?</p>
<p>--That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now
combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. <i>Que
voulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes
Ulysses quote Aristotle.</p>
<p>--Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what
the poor is not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from
the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from <i>The Two
Gentleman of Verona</i> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain
fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of
his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis,
catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was the
original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in
him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of
Maynooth - an original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in
whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words,
it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.
Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in
204
infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As you like It</i>, in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Hamlet</i>, in <i>Measure for
Measure</i>, and in all the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p>He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.</p>
<p>Judge Eglinton summed up.</p>
<p>--The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He
is all in all.</p>
<p>--He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
All in all. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, in <i>Othello</i> he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and is acted
on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen. His
unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in
him shall suffer.</p>
<p>--Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!</p>
<p>Dark dome received, reverbed.</p>
<p>--And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.
When all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas père?) is right. After God
Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p>--Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns
after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life
ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is
ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet <i>père</i> and Hamlet <i>fils</i>. A king and a prince at
last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed,
bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is
the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the
epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie,
grandpa's lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic
justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the
world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck
says: <i>If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep, If
Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend.</i> Every life is many days, day
after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old
men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love. But always meeting
ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it
badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as
they are whom the most Roman of catholics call <i>dio boia,</i> hangman god, is
doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
205
cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are
no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto
himself.</p>
<p>--<i>Eureka!</i>, Buck Mulligan cried. <i>Eureka!</i></p>
<p>Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's
desk.</p>
<p>--May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.</p>
<p>He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p>
<p>Take some slips from the counter going out.</p>
<p>--Those who are married, Mr Best, douce, herald, said, all save one, shall
live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>
<p>He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.</p>
<p>Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>.</p>
<p>--You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your
own theory?</p>
<p>--No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p>--Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a
dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.</p>
<p>John Eclection doubly smiled.</p>
<p>--Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment
for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is some
mystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in
Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is
hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke,
Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come as
a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.</p>
<p>I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me
to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? <i>Egomen.</i> Who to unbelieve? Other chap.</p>
<p>--You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for pieces of silver.
Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an
article on economics.</p>
<p>Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.</p>
<p>--For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said, honeying malice:</p>
206
<p>--I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie,
the coalquay whore.</p>
<p>He broke away.</p>
<p>--Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.</p>
<p>Come, Kinch, you have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts
and offals.</p>
<p>Stephen rose.</p>
<p>Life is many days. This will end.</p>
<p>--We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre ami</i> Moore says
Malachi Mulligan must be there.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.</p>
<p>--Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk
straight?</p>
<p>Laughing he ...</p>
<p>Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.</p>
<p>Lubber ...</p>
<p>Stephen followed a lubber ...</p>
<p>One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After his lub
back I followed. I gall his kibe.</p>
<p>Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no
thoughts.</p>
<p>What have I learned? Of them? Of me?</p>
<p>Walk like Haines now.</p>
<p>The constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor
Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet mad?
The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.</p>
<p>--O please do, sir ... I shall be most pleased ...</p>
<p>Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:</p>
<p>--A pleased bottom.</p>
<p>The turnstile.</p>
<p>Is that? ... Blueribboned hat ... Idly writing ... What? Looked? ...</p>
<p>The curving balustrade; smoothsliding Mincius.</p>
207
<p>Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:</p>
<p><i>John Eglinton, my jo, John.</i></p>
<p><i>Why won't you wed a wife?</i></p>
<p>He spluttered to the air:</p>
<p>--O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over
to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating
a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey theatre!
I smell the public sweat of monks.</p>
<p>He spat blank.</p>
<p>Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.
And left the <i>femme de trente ans</i>. And why no other children born? And his
first child a girl?</p>
<p>Afterwit. Go back.</p>
<p>The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.</p>
<p>Eh ... I just eh ... wanted ... I forgot ... he ...</p>
<p>--Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there ...</p>
<p>Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:</p>
<p><i>I hardly hear the purlieu cry</i></p>
<p><i>Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by</i></p>
<p><i>Before my thoughts begin to run</i></p>
<p><i>On F. M'Curdy Atkinson,</i></p>
<p><i>The same that had the wooden leg</i></p>
<p><i>And that filibustering filibeg</i></p>
<p><i>That never dared to slake his drouth,</i></p>
<p><i>Magee that had the chinless mouth.</i></p>
<p><i>Being afraid to marry on earth</i></p>
<p><i>They masturbated for all they were worth.</i></p>
<p>Jest on. Know thyself.</p>
<p>Halted below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.</p>
<p>--Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing
black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.</p>
<p>A laugh tripped over his lips.</p>
208
<p>--Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old
hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jew jesuit! She gets you a job on
the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn't you do the
Yeats' touch?</p>
<p>He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:</p>
<p>--The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my
time. One thinks of Homer.</p>
<p>He stopped at the stairfoot.</p>
<p>--I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.</p>
<p>The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's
morrice with caps of indices.</p>
<p>In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:</p>
<p><i>Everyman His Own Wife</i></p>
<p><i>or</i></p>
<p><i>A Honeymoon in the Hand</i></p>
<p>(<i>a national immorality in three orgasms</i>)</p>
<p><i>by</i></p>
<p><i>Ballocky Mulligan</i></p>
<p>He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p>--The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.</p>
<p>He read, <i>marcato:</i></p>
<p>--Characters:</p>
<p>T<sc>oby</sc> T<sc>ostoff</sc> (a ruined Pole).</p>
<p>C<sc>rab</sc> (a bushranger).</p>
<p>M<sc>edical</sc> D<sc>ick</sc></p>
<p>and &.in (two birds with one stone).</p>
<p>M<sc>edical</sc> D<sc>avy</sc></p>
<p>M<sc>other</sc> G<sc>rogan</sc> (a watercarrier).</p>
<p>F<sc>resh</sc> N<sc>elly</sc></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>R<sc>osalie</sc> (the coalquay whore).</p>
<p>He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:</p>
<p>--O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
209
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured,
multitudinous vomit!</p>
<p>--The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever
lifted them.</p>
<p>About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.</p>
<p>Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,
if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come
to, ineluctably.</p>
<p>My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.</p>
<p>A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.</p>
<p>--Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p>The portico.</p>
<p>Here I watched the birds for augury. Ængus of the birds. They go, they
come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after.
A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.</p>
<p>--The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did
you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient
mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.</p>
<p>Manner of Oxenford.</p>
<p>Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p>
<p>A dark back went before them. Step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
under portcullis barbs.</p>
<p>They followed.</p>
<p>Offend me still. Speak on.</p>
<p>Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of
softness softly were blown.</p>
<p>Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline, hierophantic: from
wide earth an altar.</p>
<p><i>Laud we the gods</i></p>
<p><i>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils</i></p>
<p><i>From our bless'd altars.</i></p>
