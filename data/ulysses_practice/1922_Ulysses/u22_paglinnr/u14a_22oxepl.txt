366.07  <p>Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
366.08  concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals
366.09  with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most
366.10  in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament
366.11  deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they
366.12  affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the
366.13  prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how
366.14  far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent
366.15  continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present
366.16  constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction.
366.17  For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended
366.18  but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a
366.19  downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there
366.20  inilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can contend against
366.21  the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the
366.22  exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in
366.23  the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not
366.24  with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually
366.25  traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of
366.26  profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the
366.27  hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be
367.01  than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and
367.02  promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution's
367.03  menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably
367.04  enjoined?</p>
367.05  <p>It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate,
367.06  among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired,
367.07  the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels,
367.08  leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels,
367.09  the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by
367.10  which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had
367.11  been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every
367.12  public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be
367.13  with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted
367.14  (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is
367.15  difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are
367.16  not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so
367.17  far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that
367.18  allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously
367.19  opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often
367.20  not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument
367.21  was provided.</p>
367.22  <p>To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
367.23  molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers
367.24  prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals
367.25  generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so having itself,
367.26  parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another
367.27  was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile. O thing of prudent
367.28  nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being
367.29  praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them
367.30  suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!</p>
367.31  <p>Before born babe bliss had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever
367.32  in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended
367.33  with wholesome food reposeful cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were
367.34  now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there
367.35  is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting
367.36  aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb
367.37  offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by
368.01  sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright
368.02  wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive,
368.03  it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.</p>
368.04  <p>Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming.
368.05  Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth
368.06  of man his errand that him lone led till that house.</p>
368.07  <p>Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming
368.08  mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so
368.09  God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers twey there walk, white sisters in ward
368.10  sleepless. Smarts they still sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an
368.11  hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.</p>
368.12  <p>In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising
368.13  with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in
368.14  eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin! Full she dread that God the Wreaker all
368.15  mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made she on
368.16  breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That
368.17  man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.</p>
368.18  <p>Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he
368.19  ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and
368.20  seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he
368.21  to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of
368.22  her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.
368.23  Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.</p>
368.24  <p>As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad
368.25  after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor  tidings sent
368.26  from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare Doctor
368.27  in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in
368.28  bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate
368.29  sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet
368.30  death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel
368.31  and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of
368.32  which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that
368.33  he was died in Mona island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas
368.34  and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.
368.35  He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both
368.36  awhile in wanhope, sorrowing one with other.</p>
368.37  <p>Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust
369.01  that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth
369.02  from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as
369.03  he came.</p>
369.04  <p>The man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursingwoman
369.05  and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The
369.06  nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full
369.07  three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a
369.08  little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but
369.09  never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she set it forth all
369.10  to him that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her
369.11  words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of
369.12  motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a young face for any
369.13  man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve
369.14  bloodflows chiding her childless.</p>
369.15  <p>And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed
369.16  them  a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against
369.17  the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept Dixon. And the traveller
369.18  Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each
369.19  with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by cause
369.20  the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his
369.21  breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him
369.22  for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he
369.23  might suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle for to make
369.24  merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should
369.25  go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtle. Also the lady was of
369.26  his avis and reproved the learning knight though she trowed well that the
369.27  traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learning knight
369.28  would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught
369.29  contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the
369.30  traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of
369.31  limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometimes venery.</p>
369.32  <p>And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
369.33  and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move
369.34  more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives
369.35  that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that
369.36  they fix  in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And
369.37  there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the
370.01  air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubbles. And
370.02  full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne
370.03  richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the
370.04  which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this
370.05  be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie
370.06  in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that
370.07  therein is like to the juices of the olive press. And also it was a marvel to see
370.08  in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys
370.09  out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells
370.10  up wondrously like to a vast moutain. And they teach the serpents there to
370.11  entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
370.12  these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.</p>
370.13  <p>And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
370.14  thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold
370.15  did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for
370.16  he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full
370.17  privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist
370.18  not of his wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him
370.19  there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.</p>
370.20  <p>This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at
370.21  the reverence of Jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there
370.22  was above one quick with child a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. Sir
370.23  Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it
370.24  was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or
370.25  now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin that
370.26  hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and
370.27  for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause
370.28  that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too
370.29  she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for
370.30  she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said,
370.31  Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood
370.32  tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink
370.33  and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to
370.34  their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir
370.35  Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that
370.36  was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under
370.37  hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion
371.01  service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with
371.02  wonder pondering.</p>
371.03  <p>Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
371.04  drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the
371.05  board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's with other
371.06  his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight
371.07  Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that
371.08  had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen
371.09  Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them,
371.10  reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more
371.11  mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for
371.12  that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how
371.13  he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
371.14  friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his
371.15  langour becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted
371.16  him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with
371.17  will to wander, loth to leave.</p>
371.18  <p>For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen
371.19  other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put
371.20  such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some
371.21  year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that now was trespassed
371.22  out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and
371.23  pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they said farther she should
371.24  live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain
371.25  and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden
371.26  had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these
371.27  was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as
371.28  it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law
371.29  nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said
371.30  but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live
371.31  and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with
371.32  argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each
371.33  when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then
371.34  young Madden showed all the whole affair and when he said how that she was
371.35  dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a
371.36  vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not
371.37  let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen
372.01  had these words following, Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe
372.02  and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purge
372.03  fire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly
372.04  impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and
372.05  Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means to those small
372.06  creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon
372.07  junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken
372.08  and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a
372.09  woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be
372.10  delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat  Crotthers of Alba Longa sang
372.11  young Malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium
372.12  he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their
372.13  jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus
372.14  his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.
372.15  Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold
372.16  which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he
372.17  would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might
372.18  be or wheresoever. Then spoke young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that
372.19  would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of
372.20  abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of
372.21  vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgillius saith, by the influence of the occident
372.22  or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but
372.23  lain with, <i>effectu secuto,</i> or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of
372.24  Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second
372.25  month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever
372.26  souls for God's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam
372.27  to bring forth beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the
372.28  fisherman's seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all
372.29  ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case
372.30  so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer
372.31  as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as
372.32  it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman,
372.33  and agreeing also with his experience of so seldom seen an accident it was
372.34  good for that Mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence
372.35  and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said
372.36  Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a
372.37  marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth
373.01  to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he
373.02  was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.</p>
373.03  <p>But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
373.04  pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he
373.05  was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild
373.06  which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so
373.07  dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and
373.08  for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool, the flower of the flock,
373.09  lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of
373.10  the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir
373.11  looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed
373.12  happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage
373.13  (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for
373.14  young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his
373.15  goods with whores.</p>
373.16  <p>About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
373.17  so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their
373.18  approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions
373.19  of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which
373.20  also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and
373.21  quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul's
373.22  bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone. Be not
373.23  afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will
373.24  dismay. See ye here. And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and
373.25  goldsmiths' notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he
373.26  said, for a song which he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in
373.27  such dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth:
373.28  Know all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. What means
373.29  this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush
373.30  to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman's womb word is
373.31  made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word
373.32  that shall not pass away. This is the postcreation. <i>Omnis caro ad te veniet.</i>
373.33  No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our
373.34  Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable
373.35  and Bernardus saith aptly that she hath an <i>omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem,</i> that
373.36  is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won
373.37  us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked
374.01  up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and
374.02  generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter now. Or she knew him,
374.03  that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, <i>vergine madre figlia di tuo
374.04  figlio</i> or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy
374.05  with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the
374.06  Joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages <i>parce que M. Leo
374.07  Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'était le sacré pigeon,
374.08  ventre de Dieu! Entweder</i> transsubstantiality <i>oder</i> consubstantiality but in no
374.09  case subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A
374.10  pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish,
374.11  a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will
374.12  will we withstand, withsay.</p>
374.13  <p>Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
374.14  sing a bawdy catch <i>Staboo Stabella</i> about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly
374.15  swashbuckler in Almany which he did  now attack: <i>The first three months she
374.16  was not well, Staboo,</i> when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them
374.17  hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being
374.18  her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was
374.19  jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was
374.20  an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit
374.21  dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want
374.22  of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they
374.23  reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and  with menace of blandishments
374.24  others whiles  all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he
374.25  would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in the peasestraw thou losel,
374.26  thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,
374.27  to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir
374.28  Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle,
374.29  advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most
374.30  sacred. In Horne's house rest should reign.</p>
374.31  <p>To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
374.32  Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had
374.33  not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the womb,
374.34  chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at
374.35  this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he
374.36  heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female
374.37  which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry
375.01  and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to
375.02  their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew
375.03  in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the
375.04  disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,
375.05  she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with
375.06  burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the
375.07  anthem <i>Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium</i> till she was there unmaided. He
375.08  gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master
375.09  John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their <i>Maid's Tragedy</i> that
375.10  was writ for a like twining of lovers: <i>To bed, to bed,</i> was the burden of it to be
375.11  played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet
375.12  epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the
375.13  odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal
375.14  proscenium of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon,
375.15  joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
375.16  for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said
375.17  indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and
375.18  she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in
375.19  those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than
375.20  this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou
375.21  and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius
375.22  professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever
375.23  that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy
375.24  tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. <i>Orate, fratres, pro
375.25  memetipso.</i> And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations
375.26  and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and
375.27  broughtest in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to
375.28  wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against the light
375.29  and hast made me, thy lord to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan
375.30  Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination
375.31  before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me
375.32  to the Roman and  the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie
375.33  luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from
375.34  Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a
375.35  land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter
375.36  milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left
375.37  me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes
376.01  hast thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to
376.02  say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as
376.03  mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell's gates visited a
376.04  darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith
376.05  of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of
376.06  combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's plague which in the
376.07  nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper <i>ubi</i> and <i>quomodo.</i>
376.08  And as the ends and ultimates of all things accords in some mean and measure
376.09  with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which
376.10  leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis
376.11  that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so
376.12  is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail,
376.13  batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First
376.14  saved from water of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at
376.15  last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of
376.16  the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus
376.17  nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to
376.18  Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what
376.19  region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.</p>
376.20  <p>Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly <i>Etienne chanson</i> but he loudly
376.21  bid them lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished
376.22  vault, the crystal palace of the Creator all in applepie order, a penny for him
376.23  who finds the pea.</p>
376.24  <p><i>Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack,</i></p>
376.25  <p><i>See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,</i></p>
376.26  <p><i>In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac.</i></p>
376.27  <p>A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled, back. Loud on left
376.28  Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm
376.29  that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and
376.30  witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And
376.31  he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed pale as they might all
376.32  mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift
376.33  was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the
376.34  cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock
376.35  and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master
377.01  Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow
377.02  on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy
377.03  was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.
377.04  But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne's hall.
377.05  He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
377.06  thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being
377.07  godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and
377.08  Master Bloom, at the braggart' side spoke to him calming words to slumber his
377.09  great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he
377.10  heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken
377.11  place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.</p>
377.12  <p>But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for
377.13  he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done
377.14  away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?
377.15  He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not
377.16  have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that
377.17  then he lived withal? Indeed not for Grace was not there to find that bottle.
377.18  Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer
377.19  said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless
377.20  he had plugged  up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For
377.21  through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he
377.22  must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And
377.23  would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he
377.24  and make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has
377.25  commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that
377.26  other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which
377.27  behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death
377.28  and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as
377.29  believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him
377.30  to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore
377.31  of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she
377.32  beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to
377.33  him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave
377.34  place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is
377.35  named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.</p>
377.36  <p>This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
377.37  Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand
378.01  (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would
378.02  strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding Believe-
378.03  on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no
378.04  thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very
378.05  goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with
378.06  these word printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and
378.07  Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
378.08  cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut
378.09  and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that
378.10  wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. So
378.11  were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape
378.12  Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr
378.13  Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company were ye all deceived for
378.14  that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would
378.15  presently lift his arm and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings
378.16  done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.</p>
378.17  <p>So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
378.18  after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty
378.19  mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields athirst, very
378.20  sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe and
378.21  all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as
378.22  no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread
378.23  out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at
378.24  first fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February
378.25  a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.
378.26  But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the
378.27  west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the
378.28  weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after,
378.29  past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of
378.30  shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making
378.31  shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with
378.32  kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's
378.33  lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water
378.34  running that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen
378.35  about but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice
378.36  Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college
378.37  lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come from
379.01  Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good
379.02  Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in
379.03  with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar
379.04  with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a month yet till
379.05  Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and
379.06  he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said,
379.07  but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel
379.08  and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne's.
379.09  There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal sitting snug with a covey of wags,
379.10  likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy, Vin.
379.11  Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad for a racinghorse
379.12  he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a langour he had but was
379.13  now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll
379.14  with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in
379.15  ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through
379.16  pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,
379.17  the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop
379.18  that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than
379.19  good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they say, but God give her
379.20  soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last
379.21  chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed
379.22  that died written out in a fair hand in the king's bible. Her hub fifty odd and a
379.23  methodist but takes the Sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a
379.24  pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked
379.25  reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine
379.26  bag, I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much
379.27  increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come
379.28  for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done
379.29  a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer's
379.30  gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of
379.31  reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right
379.32  guess with their queerities no telling how.</p>
379.33  <p>With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter
379.34  was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he
379.35  swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's
379.36  persuasion he gave over to search and was bidden to sit near by which he did
379.37  mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew
380.01  or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had
380.02  it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered
380.03  about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men,
380.04  runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game
380.05  or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom
380.06  he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a
380.07  boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a
380.08  platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off
380.09  with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every
380.10  mother's son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello, that is, hearing
380.11  this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his
380.12  name) 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.
380.13  But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox
380.14  on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly
380.15  he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly
380.16  in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his
380.17  embassy as he was sharpset. <i>Mort aux vaches</i>, says Frank then in the French
380.18  language that had been indentured to a brandy shipper that has a winelodge in
380.19  Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this
380.20  Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep
380.21  him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the
380.22  university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a
380.23  raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than
380.24  with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a
380.25  welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main,
380.26  then he was for the ocean sea or to foot it on the roads with the Romany folk,
380.27  kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or
380.28  choking chickens behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat has
380.29  lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the
380.30  headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, says
380.31  Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will
380.32  they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the
380.33  Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had
380.34  experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether
380.35  wools having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy
380.36  salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by
380.37  Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More
381.01  like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very
381.02  handsomely, told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the
381.03  emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over
381.04  Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy with a bolus or two
381.05  of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain
381.06  dealing. He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull
381.07  that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he
381.08  sent the ale purling about. An Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you,
381.09  says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas,
381.10  the bravest cattle breeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose. True for
381.11  you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he,
381.12  and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had
381.13  horns galore, a coat  of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils
381.14  so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed
381.15  after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon,
381.16  but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly
381.17  gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off
381.18  now, says he, and do all my cousin german the Lord Harry tells you and take
381.19  a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But
381.20  the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he
381.21  taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow
381.22  to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his
381.23  ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy
381.24  tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all
381.25  Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he in a
381.26  point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and
381.27  clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built
381.28  stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the
381.29  best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content.
381.30  By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so
381.31  heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening
381.32  dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as
381.33  his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships
381.34  a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after
381.35  him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought
381.36  to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour
381.37  to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
382.01  island with a printed notice, saying: By the lord Harry green is the grass that
382.02  grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider
382.03  in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was
382.04  sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he run amok
382.05  over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and
382.06  all by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first says
382.07  Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the
382.08  world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I'll meddle
382.09  in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help
382.10  of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when
382.11  the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a
382.12  boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that
382.13  the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful
382.14  likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in
382.15  the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the
382.16  famous champion bull of the Romans, <i>Bos Bovum</i>, which is good bog Latin for
382.17  boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head
382.18  into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it
382.19  it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him,
382.20  he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and
382.21  bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a
382.22  a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got
382.23  off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his  pockets with chalk
382.24  to write it up on what took his fancy, the side of  rock or a teahouse table or a
382.25  bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon as
382.26  fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was
382.27  that the men of the island, seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women
382.28  were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles
382.29  of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their
382.30  luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and
382.31  water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three
382.32  times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea
382.33  to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of
382.34  the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:</p>
382.35  <p>--<i>Pope Peter's but a pissabed.</i></p>
382.36  <p><i>A man's a man for a' that.</i></p>
382.37  <p>Our worthy acquaintance, Mr Malachi Mulligan, now appeared in the
383.01  doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a
383.02  friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec
383.03  Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or
383.04  a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough
383.05  to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own
383.06  for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed
383.07  round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that
383.08  day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: <i>Mr Malachi
383.09  Mulligan, Fertiliser and Incubator, Lambay Island.</i> His project, as he went on to
383.10  expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the
383.11  chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and
383.12  to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been
383.13  framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt
383.14  it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as standing.
383.15  Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating on his design, told his
383.16  hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of
383.17  sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its
383.18  turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as
383.19  whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivites
383.20  acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of
383.21  its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich
383.22  jointures, a prey for the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel
383.23  in a uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
383.24  unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
383.25  sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were
383.26  at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this
383.27  inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat) having
383.28  advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had
383.29  resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its
383.30  holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with
383.31  our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm
383.32  to be named <i>Omphalos</i> with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion
383.33  of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any
383.34  female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the
383.35  desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said,
383.36  nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less
383.37  than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers
384.01  were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his
384.02  nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of
384.03  savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific
384.04  rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed
384.05  with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily
384.06  which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice
384.07  put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, it
384.08  seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had
384.09  taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden
384.10  grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very
384.11  favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though
384.12  Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose
384.13  also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the
384.14  scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his
384.15  memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: <i>Talis ac
384.16  tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matres familiarum nostrae lascivas
384.17  cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
384.18  centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt</i> while for those of ruder wit he
384.19  drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their
384.20  stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.</p>
384.21  <p>Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man
384.22  of his person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions
384.23  of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company
384.24  lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young
384.25  gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had  befallen him,
384.26  could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving
384.27  the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger,
384.28  he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any
384.29  professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
384.30  heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come
384.31  there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an interesting
384.32  condition, poor lady, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to
384.33  know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took
384.34  on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon
384.35  which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle
384.36  or male womb or was due as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a
384.37  wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his
385.01  smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an
385.02  admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her
385.03  sex though 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard.
385.04  This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storms of mirth and threw the
385.05  whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run
385.06  on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.</p>
385.07  <p>Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume
385.08  of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young
385.09  gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his
385.10  visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of
385.11  cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole
385.12  century of polite breading had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was
385.13  united an equivalent but contrary balance of the head asked the narrator as
385.14  plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. <i>Mais
385.15  bien sûr</i>, noble stranger, said he cheerily, <i>et mille compliments</i>. That you may
385.16  and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.
385.17  But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of
385.18  water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart
385.19  to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the
385.20  happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these words he
385.21  approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial,
385.22  slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a
385.23  silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had
385.24  wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah,
385.25  Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that
385.26  affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for
385.27  her feast day as she told me) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a
385.28  tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by
385.29  generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or
385.30  to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God
385.31  I thank thee as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so
385.32  amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence
385.33  to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye
385.34  and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how
385.35  greatand universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
385.36  thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the
385.37  lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But
386.01  indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our
386.02  sublunary joys. Maledicity!  Would to God that foresight had  remembered me
386.03  to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured
386.04  seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he
386.05  cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand
386.06  thunders, I know of a <i>marchand de capotes,</i> Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can
386.07  have for a <i>livre</i> as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from
386.08  wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore,
386.09  that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle <i>avec lui</i> in
386.10  a circle of the best wits of the town) is my authority that in Cape Horn,
386.11  <i>ventre biche,</i> they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.
386.12  A drenching of that violence, he tells me, <i>sans blague,</i> has sent more than one
386.13  luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A <i>livre!</i>
386.14  cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella,
386.15  were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No
386.16  woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she
386.17  would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of
386.18  salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my
386.19  ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies) dame
386.20  Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our heart and it has become
386.21  a household word that <i>il y a deux choses</i> for which the innocence of our original
386.22  garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay the
386.23  only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed
386.24  her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer
386.25  chamber of my ear) the first is a bath ... but at this point a bell tinkling in the
386.26  hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our
386.27  store of knowledge.</p>
386.28  <p>Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all
386.29  were conjecturing what might be the cause Miss Callan entered and, having
386.30  spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound
386.31  bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of
386.32  debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less
386.33  severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious
386.34  but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly,
386.35  said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh!
386.36  I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way
386.37  with them? Gad's bud. Immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it
387.01  is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck
387.02  the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty
387.03  who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy,
387.04  doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper
387.05  and immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man!
387.06  Bless me, I'm all of a wibblywobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father
387.07  Cantekissem that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello,
387.08  if she ain't in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick
387.09  as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the
387.10  company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he
387.11  was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period
387.12  to the sufferings of the lady who was <i>enceinte</i> which she had borne with a
387.13  laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience,
387.14  said he, with those who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile
387.15  an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the
387.16  greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if
387.17  need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble
387.18  exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive
387.19  in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one,
387.20  the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment
387.21  of ours and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of
387.22  clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where
387.23  the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is
387.24  rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of
387.25  this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A
387.26  murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker
387.27  without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have
387.28  received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by
387.29  affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was
387.30  as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he,
387.31  them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up
387.32  most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
387.33  to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on
387.34  with a loving heart.</p>
387.35  <p>To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry had been conscious of
387.36  some impudent mocks which he, however, had born with being the fruits of
387.37  that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young
388.01  sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the
388.02  words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often
388.03  nice: their testiness and outrageous <i>mots</i> were such that his intellects resiled
388.04  from: nor were they scrupuluosly sensible of the proprieties though their fund
388.05  of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was
388.06  an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to
388.07  him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and
388.08  thrust like a crookback teethed and feet first into the world, which the dint of
388.09  the surgeon's pliers in his skill lent indeed a colour to, so as it put him in
388.10  thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious
388.11  Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years
388.12  that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of
388.13  a wary ascendancy and self a man of a rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart
388.14  to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the
388.15  readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which
388.16  base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.
388.17  To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of
388.18  mind which be never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear
388.19  the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that,
388.20  having lost all forbearance can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote
388.21  of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious
388.22  retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring
388.23  nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the
388.24  chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet
388.25  not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a
388.26  gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while
388.27  from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,
388.28  however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the
388.29  issue so ausspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to
388.30  the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.</p>
388.31  <p>Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
388.32  his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one)
388.33  was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced
388.34  by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in
388.35  such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her
388.36  husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless
388.37  she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers,
389.01  clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory
389.02  Allelujerum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring
389.03  through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls
389.04  her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.
389.05  'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old
389.06  bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praising of it,
389.07  each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former
389.08  view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in
389.09  orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every
389.10  household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully
389.11  unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal
389.12  dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity,
389.13  that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a
389.14  pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art
389.15  which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further
389.16  added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them
389.17  for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.</p>
389.18  <p>But with what fitness, let it be asked, of the noble lord, his patron,
389.19  has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civil
389.20  rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where
389.21  is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the
389.22  recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados
389.23  did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece
389.24  against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the
389.25  security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits
389.26  received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at
389.27  last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only
389.28  enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable
389.29  lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections
389.30  upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
389.31  interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman she has been too
389.32  long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his
389.33  objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says
389.34  this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple,
389.35  oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female
389.36  domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy's
389.37  scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with
390.01  Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity
390.02  is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant
390.03  rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were
390.04  bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a
390.05  seedfield that lies fallow for the want of a ploughshare? A habit reprehensible
390.06  at puberty is second nature and an opprobium in middle life. If he must
390.07  dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to
390.08  restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better
390.09  with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository
390.10  of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some
390.11  faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this
390.12  new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which,
390.13  when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm
390.14  but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam
390.15  vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.</p>
390.16  <p>The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
390.17  usages of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior
390.18  medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that
390.19  an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment
390.20  to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the
390.21  secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council,
390.22  silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing
390.23  under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful
390.24  occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail
390.25  and officer rendered the easier broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In
390.26  vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to
390.27  mollify, to restrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that
390.28  discursiveness which seemed the only band of union among tempers so
390.29  divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the
390.30  prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity
390.31  with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the
390.32  fratricidal case known as the Childs murder and rendered memorable by the
390.33  impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the
390.34  wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching
390.35  twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated and dissimulated,
390.36  acardiac <i>foetus in foetu,</i> aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnatia of certain
390.37  chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of
391.01  defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he
391.02  said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or
391.03  twilight sleep, the prolungation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by
391.04  reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid
391.05  (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
391.06  artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent
391.07  upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case
391.08  of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of
391.09  delivery called by the Brandenburghers <i>Sturzgeburt,</i> the recorded instances of
391.10  multigeminal, twikindled and monstruous births conceived during the
391.11  catamenic period or of consanguineous parents -- in a word all the cases of
391.12  human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with
391.13  chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and
391.14  forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular
391.15  beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to
391.16  step over a country stile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle
391.17  her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently
391.18  and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person
391.19  which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities
391.20  of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark
391.21  and portwine stain were alleged by one as a <i>primafacie</i> and natural hypothetical
391.22  explanation of  swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not
391.23  forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic
391.24  memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical
391.25  traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic
391.26  development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate
391.27  sustained against both these views with such heat as almost carried conviction
391.28  the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority
391.29  being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur
391.30  which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages
391.31  of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but
391.32  shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from
391.33  Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he
391.34  knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean
391.35  old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between
391.36  Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and
391.37  theological dilemma  in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other,
392.01  the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for
392.02  instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether
392.03  the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb
392.04  with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered
392.05  briefly, and as some thought perfunctorily, the ecclesiastical ordinance
392.06  forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.</p>
392.07  <p>But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the
392.08  scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the
392.09  recess appeared ... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a
392.10  portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked
392.11  <i>Poison</i>. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them
392.12  with a ghastly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch
392.13  laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer
392.14  of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.
392.15  This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting
392.16  at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my
392.17  share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My
392.18  hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.
392.19  Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum
392.20  (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me.
392.21  Dope is my only hope ... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he
392.22  suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared
392.23  in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland row station at ten past
392.24  eleven. He was gone! Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The
392.25  seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mannanaun!
392.26  The sage repeated <i>Lex talionis</i>. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy
392.27  without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias,
392.28  overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the
392.29  third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the
392.30  ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much
392.31  thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live
392.32  there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers
392.33  from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer's ground.</p>
392.34  <p>What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the
392.35  chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry
392.36  and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.
392.37  No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of
393.01  reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in
393.02  the funds.  He is young Leopold, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror
393.03  within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of
393.04  then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old
393.05  house in Clambrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him
393.06  bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought. Or
393.07  it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was
393.08  a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm,
393.09  equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his
393.10  case of bright trinketware (alas, a thing now of the past!), and a quiverful of
393.11  compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her
393.12  fingertips or for a budding virgin shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!)
393.13  his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile but more than these, the dark eyes
393.14  and oleaginous address brought home at duskfall many a commission to the
393.15  head of the firm seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle
393.16  (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned
393.17  spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto,
393.18  the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels,
393.19  to a tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him
393.20  might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He
393.21  thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the
393.22  first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all
393.23  for a bare shilling and her luckpenny) together they hear the heavy tread of
393.24  the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie!
393.25  Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night, first
393.26  night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer
393.27  with the willed, and in an instant (<i>fiat!</i>) light shall flood the world. Did
393.28  heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath 'twas done but -- hold!
393.29  Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She
393.30  is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden
393.31  babe of day. No, Leopold! Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful
393.32  illusion of thy strength was taken from thee  and in vain. No son of thy loins is
393.33  by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.</p>
393.34  <p>The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite
393.35  of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of
393.36  generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never
393.37  falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial
394.01  dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her
394.02  fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they yet moulded in prophetic grace of
394.03  structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek
394.04  apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste
394.05  land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is
394.06  no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of
394.07  rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and
394.08  goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and
394.09  yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come
394.10  trooping to the sunken sea, <i>Lacus Mortis</i>. Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host!
394.11  They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted
394.12  with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler,
394.13  rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude,
394.14  murderers of the sun.</p>
394.15  <p>Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
394.16  gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent grows
394.17  again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude till
394.18  it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And, lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it
394.19  is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It
394.20  is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How
394.21  serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate
394.22  antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do
394.23  you call it gossamer! It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it
394.24  streams emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of cold
394.25  interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a
394.26  mysterious writing till after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes,
394.27  Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.</p>
394.28  <p>Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
394.29  school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
394.30  Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the
394.31  past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into
394.32  life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who
394.33  supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and
394.34  giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves,
394.35  smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will
394.36  adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful
394.37  of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well hope this for
395.01  you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate. I heartily wish
395.02  you may not fail them. O no, Vincent, Lenehan said, laying a hand on the
395.03  shoulder near him, have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan.
395.04  The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to
395.05  be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn
395.06  from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost
395.07  five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: Lenehan as much more.
395.08  He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh, off, scamper, the mare ran out
395.09  freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field: all hearts were beating.
395.10  Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!
395.11  Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close
395.12  order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All
395.13  was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she
395.14  cried, I am  undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright
395.15  casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear
395.16  fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four
395.17  winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount him on
395.18  the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But
395.19  let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre!
395.20  he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this
395.21  hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you
395.22  remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent
395.23  said, how young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in
395.24  her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.
395.25  The chestnuts that shaded us were  in bloom: the air drooped with their
395.26  persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one
395.27  might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit
395.28  in them that Periplepomenos sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had
395.29  nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she
395.30  nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four
395.31  days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is
395.32  more taking then. Her posies too! Mad romp that it is, she had pulled her
395.33  fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend,  you will not think
395.34  who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the
395.35  hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it
395.36  from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours
395.37  in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of
396.01  underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed
396.02  she glanced at her lovely echo in the little mirror she carries. But he had been
396.03  kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan
396.04  said. If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve
396.05  me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it
396.06  and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily,
396.07  Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful
396.08  perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely
396.09  regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you
396.10  not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a
396.11  previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.
396.12  The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from
396.13  planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these
396.14  were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.</p>
396.15  <p>However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
396.16  being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was
396.17  entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at
396.18  all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on, were
396.19  at this juncture commencing to exibit symptoms of animation, was as astute if
396.20  not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary
396.21  would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the
396.22  past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount
396.23  of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which
396.24  happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he
396.25  was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account
396.26  of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired
396.27  for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different
396.28  complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations about
396.29  boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his
396.30  own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.
396.31  Eventually, however, both their eyes met and, as soon as it began to dawn on
396.32  him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing, he
396.33  involontarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold
396.34  of  the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and
396.35  made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same
396.36  time however, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to
396.37  upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.</p>
397.01  <p>The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
397.02  course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters
397.03  were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and
397.04  most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never beheld an assembly so
397.05  representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever
397.06  listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made.
397.07  Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his
397.08  face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite
397.09  to him was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early
397.10  depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned
397.11  to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat
397.12  form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth
397.13  but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts
397.14  and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and
397.15  and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head
397.16  of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of
397.17  pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic
397.18  discussion, while to right and left of him were accomodated the flippant
397.19  prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled
397.20  by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible
397.21  dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat
397.22  or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which
397.23  the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.</p>
397.24  <p>It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
397.25  transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would
397.26  appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted
397.27  scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible
397.28  phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded
397.29  facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may
397.30  be, it is true, some questons which science cannot answer -- at present --
397.31  such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding
397.32  the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of
397.33  Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is
397.34  responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa
397.35  or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline
397.36  to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold
397.37  and Valenti, a mixture of both. This would be tantamount to a cooperation
398.01  (one of nature's favourite devices) between the <i>nisus formativus</i> of the nemasperm
398.02  on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, <i>succubitus felix</i>,
398.03  of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is
398.04  scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently
398.05  remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.
398.06  Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which
398.07  our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling
398.08  the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleges, and the revolting
398.09  spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of
398.10  all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers,
398.11  the suspened carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified
398.12  duennas -- these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the
398.13  calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted
398.14  and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light
398.15  philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues
398.16  such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all
398.17  these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition
398.18  to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers
398.19  (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case
398.20  of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital
398.21  discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or
398.22  official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of
398.23  criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the
398.24  former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case
398.25  he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is
398.26  too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder
398.27  is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all
398.28  things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often
398.29  balk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out
398.30  by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well
398.31  as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood
398.32  temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop
398.33  from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless
398.34  flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as
398.35  yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
398.36  normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked
398.37  after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the
399.01  same marriage do not) must certainly in the poet's words, give us pause.
399.02  Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever
399.03  she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation
399.04  by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence
399.05  (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can
399.06  be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of
399.07  development, an arrangement, which, though productive of pain to some of
399.08  our feelings (notably the maternal) is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
399.09  run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.
399.10  Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that
399.11  an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass
399.12  through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such
399.13  multifarious aliments as cancrenous femoules emaciated by parturition, corpulent
399.14  professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns
399.15  might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals
399.16  as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.
399.17  For the enlightenment of those who  are not so intimately acquainted with the
399.18  minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded  esthete and embryo
399.19  philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific
399.20  can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should
399.21  perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lower class
399.22  licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
399.23  dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom
399.24  (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity
399.25  Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne
399.26  (Lic. in Midw., F.K.Q.C.P.I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported
399.27  by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the
399.28  bag (an esthetic allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and
399.29  marvellous of all nature's processes, the act of sexual congress) she must let it
399.30  out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her
399.31  own was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor none the less effective for the
399.32  moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.</p>
399.33  <p>Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
399.34  happy <i>accouchement</i>. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and
399.35  doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had
399.36  manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was
399.37  very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy
400.01  too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at
400.02  her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger
400.03  for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new
400.04  motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the
400.05  Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only
400.06  one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to
400.07  lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is
400.08  older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet
400.09  in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second
400.10  accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of
400.11  old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses!
400.12  With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God, how
400.13  beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her
400.14  imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick
400.15  Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet
400.16  Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the
400.17  South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last
400.18  pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy
400.19  nose. Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential
400.20  third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin
400.21  Castle. And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No,
400.22  let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the
400.23  ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings
400.24  for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the
400.25  Sacred Book for the oil too has run low and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to
400.26  rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have fought the
400.27  good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well
400.28  done, thou good and faithful servant!</p>
400.29  <p>There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories
400.30  which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide
400.31  there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as
400.32  though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at
400.33  least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they
400.34  will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a
400.35  dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver
400.36  tranquillity of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled
400.37  with wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
401.01  under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
401.02  shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.</p>
401.03  <p>The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that
401.04  false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon
401.05  words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a <i>flair,</i> for
401.06  the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the observer's memory,
401.07  evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days
401.08  were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.
401.09  A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of
401.10  lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game
401.11  but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the
401.12  sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And
401.13  yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful
401.14  irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their
401.15  darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of
401.16  the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the
401.17  foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of
401.18  four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the
401.19  kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing
401.20  on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just
401.21  as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of  danger
401.22  but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the
401.23  <i>piazzetta</i> giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of
401.24  reproach <i>(alles vergängliche)</i> in her glad look.</p>
401.25  <p>Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that
401.26  antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.
401.27  Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody rather,
401.28  befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of
401.29  angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning
401.30  the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in
401.31  swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber,
401.32  impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of
401.33  shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the
401.34  reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not
401.35  otherwise  was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the
401.36  utterance of the Word.</p>
401.37  <p>Burke's! Outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail
402.01  of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at
402.02  heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and
402.03  scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble
402.04  every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them
402.05  nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full
402.06  pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They
402.07  are out tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's of
402.08  Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows, giving them sharp
402.09  language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a
402.10  thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there.
402.11  Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of
402.12  watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor. Then all
402.13  being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going:
402.14  Madam, when come the storkbird for thee?</p>
402.15  <p>The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
402.16  celestial, glistering on Dublin stone there under starshiny <i>coelum</i>. God's air,
402.17  the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air. Breathe it deep into thee.
402.18  By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch!
402.19  Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering
402.20  allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed
402.21  Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of
402.22  man's work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let
402.23  scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore.
402.24  Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's bills at home and ingots
402.25  (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou
402.26  shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy
402.27  Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog
402.28  is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod,
402.29  without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without
402.30  population! No, say I! Herod's slaughter of the innocents were the truer name.
402.31  Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,
402.32  bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,
402.33  quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire
402.34  neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to
402.35  threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music.
402.36  Twenty years of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that
402.37  will and would and wait and never  do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask,
403.01  and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathusthra?
403.02  <i>Deine Kuh Truebsal melkest Du. Nun trinkst Du die suesse Milch des Euters.</i> See!
403.03  It displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother's milk,
403.04  Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning stars overhead,
403.05  rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in
403.06  their guzzlingden, milk of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan's land. Thy
403.07  cow's dug was tough, what? Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening.
403.08  No dollop this but thick rich bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! <i>Per deam
403.09  Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum!</i></p>
