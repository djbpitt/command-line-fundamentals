437.26  to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to

437.28  carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There
437.29  might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over
437.30  a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to
437.31  lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate
438.01  surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised

439.02  started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The
439.03  trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity,
439.04  brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
439.05  being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh.

439.09  There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family.
439.10  If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that
439.11  have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord,
439.12  is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of

439.34  Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the

465.09  <p>(<i>In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow.</i>) Dr Bloom is bisexually
465.10  abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for
465.11  demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the
465.12  consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered
465.13  among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism.
465.14  Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely
465.15  idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence
465.16  of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to
465.17  be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination
465.18  and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and
465.19  pubic hairs, I declare him to be <i>virgo intacta</i>.</p>

465.31  <p>(<i>Reads a bill of health.</i>) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new
465.32  womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found
466.01  him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole,
466.02  coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really
466.03  beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed
466.04  Priests Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total
466.05  abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most
466.06  Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer
466.07  and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a
466.08  firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he
466.09  was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most
466.10  sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about
466.11  to have a baby.</p>

496.04  unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the
496.05  general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle
496.06  cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling
496.07  bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It
496.08  runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from
496.09  it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat.
496.10  Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed
496.11  with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably ... (<i>He winces.</i>)

521.07  <p>How is that? <i>Le distrait</i> or absentminded beggar. (<i>He fumbles again in his

521.19  <p>I will but is it wise? (<i>He counts.</i>) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six.
521.20  Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.</p>
521.21            <p><sc>stephen</sc></p>
521.22  <p>Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing
521.23  says. Thirsty fox. (<i>He laughs loudly.</i>) Burying his grandmother. Probably he
521.24  killed her.</p>
521.25            <p><sc>bloom</sc></p>
521.26  <p>That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.</p>

522.10  <p>(<i>Brings the match nearer his eye.</i>) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them
522.11  yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (<i>He draws the
522.12  match away. It goes out.</i>) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the
